LaMelo Ball this preseason has been wild—nutmegging defenders and pulling up from 30 feet like Steph Curry. It’s definitely entertaining to watch, but honestly, who cares? Because everywhere you look across the league, the vibe isn’t excitement, it’s straight-up hate. The NBA seems to be thinking, “Yeah, he’s flashy. But he’s also a...” “Loser.” Even last season, when LaMelo Ball was leading all guards in all-star fan votes, coaches and the media still kept him off the roster. That’s how much they overlook him. But now, it’s worse than ever. The doubt around him has hit a new peak. Still, there’s one person who... Still holds firm in his belief. My sons are kind of like phones—I keep upgrading them, making them better over time. No, not him. I’m actually talking about the ringer, Zack Low, the most trusted media personality among front offices. When he backs LaMelo, it really carries weight. But this kind of pattern isn’t new for us. We’re drawn to… They build up NBA players just to knock them down. Came in as Rookie of the Year, made the All-Star team in his second season. But now it’s year six, and the progress has been rough. Charlotte has never finished better than a 10th seed and hasn’t even come close to the playoffs. So it’s not really about when the Hornets are going to turn things around anymore. Can they ever really come out on top with LaMelo as their star? According to Tim McMahon from ESPN, LaMelo is an incredible talent, no doubt, but he’s not the guy to lead a team to victory. And honestly, that opinion isn’t exactly breaking news to anyone who's been paying attention around the league. Just take a look, you’ll see what I mean. At the latest top 100 rankings right before the season kicks off, Darius Garland is surprisingly not sitting very high. Check out the Ringer and Bleacher Report – they’re not great. Meanwhile, ESPN has him ranked 63rd, sandwiched between Christian Brown and Jaylen Suggs. That’s pretty wild, considering Garland’s skill set and impact. He’s not even in the same league as Garland in most eyes. So, why the gap? Well, there are three main reasons, and I’ll start with the one that even the most casual fans might see coming. LaMelo’s biggest supporters can’t argue with that, for sure. But you all know I took a trip to Greece this summer. It was really amazing.

If your last name is Ball, injuries tend to be part of the package, but LaMelo definitely takes that to a different level altogether. Zion Williamson has sat out 55% of possible games, Joel Embiid has missed 49%, and even Anthony Davis is only available for about 74% of the season. Meanwhile, LaMelo Ball is on a similar path to Derek Rose, a name almost synonymous with injury issues. But here’s the interesting part—when folks claim LaMelo can’t win, they’re not actually talking about his health. So, what’s really behind that? What they’re really saying is that they just don’t like his style of play. So, let’s break down LaMelo’s game in 2025—the highlights and the stuff he can improve on. Last year, he shot more threes than anyone else, averaging 11.2 per game. His shooting percentage, though, was only 34%, which is pretty low. But honestly, LaMelo has some serious shooting skills. Some of his three-pointers are straight-up Steph Curry level, looking almost effortless and perfect. Check out how this defender tries to go for a steal, but instead of taking advantage of the open floor, Lenel just tosses up a heavily contested three. It’s almost something Steph would pull off—because he’s capable—and LaMelo is really getting good at those one-footed threes too. Coaches might not love it, but LaMelo’s got confidence and the touch to make it count. He’s got that natural flair because he’s really talented. But one thing that bugs people about his style of play is this. LaMelo clearly knows he’s good, but sometimes that confidence makes him take these difficult contested threes early in the shot clock, and it’s just not smart. It’s straight-up hero ball—more like James Harden than Steph Curry. Like, Trey Man is wide open, and he’s not even considering passing or taking a better shot. What are your thoughts on that? How are you doing? Another solid move that Ball has in his toolkit is the floaters. Last year, he averaged about four of them per game, hitting 48%. The only player who shot more and with a higher percentage was Trey Young. Ball also has a knack for slowing down in pick-and-roll situations, really cutting off his man and controlling the play. That height and length really help him rise up and take that smooth push shot. But one thing LaMelo doesn’t do enough of is attacking the rim all the way. For some reason, he tends to shy away from contact. Just check out all the open space in the paint as he shifts to the hoop—the opportunity is right there. Instead of going straight at the big’s body for a layup or trying to draw a foul, he grabs the ball early and sidesteps the contact, opting for a trickier shot. Why? Because the guy has the skills to score at the rim. He’s got the length and footwork to control the situation, but he only gets… He averages five assists a game. Honestly, he should be getting way more with how often he handles the ball. But what really stands out about LaMelo Ball is his vision — his biggest strength. The guy has eyes everywhere and the length to thread passes that most players just can't see. This play here is a perfect example of that. LaMelo takes off across the court, then notices the weak side defense collapsing down, just about to cut off that passing lane. He scrolls his eyes, then effortlessly threads a left-handed feed through a narrow gap. It's incredible to watch. But, you know, with a daring playmaker like him, turnovers come with the territory—three and a half per game, to be exact. And honestly, you’ve got to expect that kind of risk to see those spectacular highlights. a lot of these are his teammates just not being ready for the pass. But let's switch over to defense because LaMelo gets a lot of hate for that. At 67, he can be an above average defender, but LaMelo's focus is inconsistent. First, remember how he avoids contact. Yeah, he does that on screens, too. But if you give any top tier guard this much space as they come off a screen, your backlight defense going to get cooked. And that inconsistent focus bleeds over to LaMelo's gap defense, there are many times where he lazily goes for a steal, leaves a wide open shot. Got lucky there. or just ball watching, having his back turned to the guy he's on, which becomes a bucket. But the big concern here is we've rarely seen LaMelo in a true big- time must-win situation. Growing up, casual AA style of basketball, which has kind of been the same vibe in Charlotte for 5 years. But this is where Zack Low actually pushes back. He argues that many of LaMelo's worst habits, shot selection, hero ball, aren't really his fault. Who is he even supposed to be passing to? It's not like Charlotte has built a contender around him. And honestly, the Hornets are where careers go to die. They have never had a true superstar, never made a conference finals, missed the playoffs nine straight years. There are a few teams that you do not want to be drafted by. Kings, Wizards, Pelicans, Hornets are on that list. I mean, you need Michael Jordan to turn that around. Oh, wait. But expecting LaMelo Ball to be that guy at 24 years old is unfair. But it also brings us to the third reason that these people doubt him. And the one The whole story could shift if LaMelo pulls this off because then the critics would look pretty foolish. For a while, Steph Curry was stuck with the same reputation. People saw him as incredibly talented but doubted his ability to win big. They said he was too slight, too fragile, and couldn’t carry a team to a title. And at first, those doubts made sense. Steph’s ankles nearly derailed his career early on, making it easy for critics to doubters to write him off. The Warriors didn't make it far in the playoffs that year. But during the 2013-14 season, Steph Curry started to change the game for himself. He focused on transforming his physique, brought in trainers, but more than anything, he learned to drop his ego. He fully bought into Steve Kerr's system of ball movement rather than chasing personal stats, and that shift was the key to building a dynasty. Giannis Antetokounmpo is another example of a player making a similar evolution. It took four years, but the message was straightforward. Build a wall, and he's finished. Giannis was a star during the regular season, but he hadn’t yet proven himself as a champion. Then, during the off-season, he doubled down and dedicated himself to the gym. He focused on tackling his flaws—improving his free throws, finishing stronger through contact—and by the 2021 finals, he was knocking down 17 of 19 at the line. That game was a 50-point blowout to close out the season. So, what do Steph and Giannis share? It’s their obsession with winning, no matter what. The criticism or haters? They bothered them, pushed them to improve. Some guys settle for an All-Star nod and a max contract, and that’s okay. But is that LaMelo? That's what I’m wondering. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure. Maybe. Usually, you can tell when someone’s more of a James Harden type than a Steph Curry. It’s those vibes that count more than the trophy case, you know? But to be fair, LaMelo is only 24. He’s been labeled a jokester ever since he was a kid—the little brother on the team who’s always cracking jokes. Imagine growing up with a dad who’s a WWE promoter and having that as your main reputation—that’s the vibe that’s stuck with him. But honestly, don’t focus on his defensive skills or anything like that. Look at players like Steph Curry or Steve Nash—they’ve shown you can succeed even if you’re not a lockdown defender. LaMelo’s journey to proving people wrong isn’t about his physical game; it’s all in his mind. Right now, the league's not sold on him, just like it once doubted Steph and Giannis. The real question is whether he cares enough and can stay healthy enough to prove everyone wrong. But there are definitely some guys the league has given up on, and honestly, they're pretty much out of the picture. The league’s main player I’m referring to is Bull Bowl. He spent six consecutive years trying to show everyone he was an NBA-level talent, but now he’s out of the league altogether. A lot of folks might just dismiss that and say, “Oh, he couldn’t handle it, he’s just not good enough.” But… Actually, during his final year with Phoenix, there was one incident that really derailed him. After that moment, it’s possible we might never see him back in the league again.
