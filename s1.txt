More information has surfaced about Giannis leaving the Bucks. Ian Begley, known as the top New York reporter, revealed that back in August, the Knicks actually made a serious offer—not just a minor one, but a legit deal. We get a pretty good idea of what that offer looked like because Begley also mentions Jaylen Brunson. He was completely untouchable. So, it seems likely the Knicks reached out either asking for Giannis in exchange for OG Anobi and Mikal Bridges plus some draft picks, or they offered Giannis for Carl Anthony Towns plus Tyler Kick to balance salaries and pick deals. But apparently, the Knicks ended the call and moved on. I just found out about this now, two months later, right before the season kicks off. Why would someone drop this info now? It definitely wasn’t the Bucks who leaked it—they’re not about that life, considering how much they’re trying to hide things on their social media. They’re really pushing to act like everything’s cool and under control. Nothing's really happening. It’s like that meme with the house on fire, you know? “This is fine,” but it’s just people posting stuff like, “Oh, Giannis says he loves Milwaukee, everyone.” Just... relax. Don’t get so defensive about it. It’s only making things worse. It’s kind of like what Devin Carter from the Kings was doing last night, acting like, “Oh, if...” If I let my hair grow long enough, it’ll probably hide this hairline of mine. But honestly, we all know what’s really happening. Gotta face the truth. Giannis is rocking a pretty rough hairline for the Bucks at the moment. I’m not saying they should shave it all off and trade him, but let’s not pretend everything's perfect either. The Knicks didn't spill this info either. They probably want to avoid a situation where Carl Anthony Towns hears about a potential trade right before the season, thinking the team tried to move him. So that leaves just one possible leaker. We’re only about two weeks away from the NBA season starting. Until then, it’s all about Prize Picks. This spot’s the best for scoring cash while catching your favorite sports. Just last week, our pick came through, which was pretty awesome. And guess what? We’re giving it another shot this week. But honestly, I had a better time regardless of whether I won or lost watching that last NFL game. The game just needs to hit for that to work, but the coolest part is how simple the app is to use. You put together a lineup, and all you need to do is adjust a few players' stats up or down. For instance, this week I’m focusing on my first big WNBA game, and I’m choosing to go with less on some of the stats. Talking about Chelsea Gray’s assists, and of course, it’s NFL Sunday, so Derrick Henry’s in the spotlight along with a deep dive into his fantasy points. Fingers crossed we hit both predictions again after a couple of strong weeks. By the way, PrizePicks is up and running in 45 states, including Texas—where I’m at—and California. Plus, when you play just your... Start with just $5 and immediately score $50 in free lineups—no matter if you win or lose—by using the code AM hoops. That’s right, play your first five, and you'll get 50 bucks in free lineups on the spot, whether you come out ahead or not. Sham mentioned something interesting the other day, so just pay attention. Take a glance around the league and… He's planning to keep his options open, I'm told, and he's working with his agent, Alex Roatz from Octagon. Since the May draft combine, there's been a lot of buzz about Giannis, and he's been handling a ton of interest. He'll be the main person managing and guiding this whole situation. What? How does he know that? Because… Giannis’s agent shared this with Shams, since that’s where he often gets a lot of his info from other agents. The move seems designed to put some pressure on the Bucks and make sure everyone else knows what’s coming. Essentially, it’s like a signal: hey, my guy might be on his way out, so start getting your offers together. And by the way, Giannis has his own ask. He’s playing the good guy, pretending to be all in front of the cameras. Meanwhile, his agent’s the one spreading the news, doing his dirty work behind the scenes. Everyone can see through it. Giannis was the one who leaked this info through his agent just to put the Bucks in a better position, making it look like he’s fully committed. We all get the real story here. Notice, Giannis would never pull something like that. He's a genuinely good guy. No way his agent would go behind his back and do something like that without Giannis giving the okay. The agent would be out of a job the very next day. When the Milwaukee media asked Giannis about it, he responded, "I've said this many times. I..." I'm really aiming to be in a situation where I can come out on top, and I truly believe in this team. The second I walk onto that court, I’m all in, focused on whatever’s in front of me. If in six or seven months I decide differently, that’s just how humans work. You're making things worse, Giannis. If you've made a commitment, don't go and add, "Oh, I might change my mind" afterward. It totally undermines everything else you've just said. If you genuinely don't believe Giannis is responsible for these unexpected leaks, then I honestly don't know what to tell you. But what’s making you think he's not involved? Releasing this just before the season kicks off? Keep in mind, Giannis has been in this situation before—not once, but three times. Back in 2020, the Bucks had a surprising meltdown in the bubble. Giannis made it pretty clear that if they weren’t competing for a title, he wasn’t gonna bother playing for them. So, the... Before the 2021 season, the Bucks made a huge move by trading a massive package of players and picks to bring in Drew Holiday. Just a few weeks after that, Giannis signed his Supermax extension to commit to Milwaukee. It was like, yeah, we're all in, and Giannis is all in too. Then in 2023, he made it clear he wouldn’t sign again unless the team was truly a contender. So, to boost their chances, Milwaukee went all in once more, making a big push to acquire Damian Lillard. Lillard, and once more, Giannis keeps pushing forward into 2024, even after an early playoff exit. Giannis words, "I don’t want to be 40 and look back wishing I had one more shot." Because of that mindset, they end up firing Coach Adrien Griffin midway through the season—definitely a desperate attempt to keep the superstar satisfied. But honestly, this kind of thing isn't out of the ordinary. Giannis has a history of making these kinds of moves all the time. Whenever he senses things are about to go bad, he ramps up the pressure. That’s not something new; it’s kind of his way. Take Kobe Bryant, for instance. He wasn’t planning to be a lifer with the Lakers. When Shaq left for Miami, Kobe was furious. He even called out a trade on camera and made it clear he’d never want to stay a Lakers player again. Jersey once again. Quite the tough break, huh? But then the Lakers made a move for Pau Gasol, and that turned things around, helping them secure back-to-back championships. Kobe finished his career as a Laker. Even Tim Duncan almost decided to leave the Spurs, with Orlando Magic showing interest, and both sides thinking it was a great match. But in the end, he stayed. Tim stays loyal to San Antonio, and together they end up securing five championship rings. But here’s the wild part of the story: Duncan once asked Magic’s former coach, Doc Rivers, if his wife could join them on the team plane. Rivers turned him down, and Duncan was like, “Never mind.” I’m sticking with Coach Pop. The thing with Giannis is, every time he throws out a threat, the Bucks usually respond and make a move. But honestly, that’s only happened successfully once with Drew Holiday. It’s kind of like if Kobe had Pau Gasol on his team, but he still kept losing in the first round every year. Kobe would’ve been frustrated, no doubt. It really gets under my skin that someone like Charles Barkley would say things about the Greek Freak like that. It’s kind of wild how these guys, they act like they’re automatically owed a shot at the championship every single year. It’s pretty sad that he feels like he’s somehow entitled to win the title every season. Everyone’s got that desire, sure, but it’s not a given. What’s he even talking about? First off, Chuck decided to leave Philly to go try his luck and win in Phoenix. Then, this guy shows up in my hometown, Houston, teaming up with Scotty Pippen in an attempt to chase that championship. And now all of a sudden, Giannis isn’t allowed to do the same? Feels like everyone’s got a double standard here. Giannis hasn't gotten past the second round since he won in 2021. He's faced three straight first-round exits during that time, even though he's been regarded as the second best player in the world the entire time. Some of it was due to injuries, but he doesn’t act like he’s owed anything. He just wants to get out there and play. Being considered a truly meaningful all-world basketball player—does that sound like too much to ask? Giannis is once again showing his relentless drive, putting pressure on everyone around him just like he always does. But unless some kind of miracle occurs this time, what would a trade even look like? There are basically only two possible directions this could go, because the situation is pretty straightforward at this point. The Bucks don’t hold onto any of their first-round picks until 2031. That means, when it comes to trades, they’re either after a package centered around established players to stay competitive or they’re looking to get their own picks back so they can rebuild. That’s really the only options. So, if the Knicks are involved in a deal, it could actually make sense if the Bucks are interested. Stay in the game, but unfortunately, they already turned down a deal without Jaylen Brunson. If it doesn't change, they’re pretty much out. The East isn’t exactly stacked either. If the Knicks somehow make it to the finals, it’s unlikely they’ll blow everything up at that point. So, the real question is—who actually holds the rights to the Bucks' picks that they’re trying to get? Want to know how things shake out? Well, the Hawks hold the power in 2026, but honestly, that’s not the big story. Giannis is on the roster, and after that, it’s the Pels and mostly the Blazers. Honestly, being a Blazers fan right now is pretty exciting—they’re in a prime position to make big moves when the time is right. They’re really set to capitalize once everything unfolds. And if the Rockets… So, if there's a three-team trade on the table, Portland's basically saying, "Sure, no worries. We’ll swap the picks for Reed Shepard and those Suns picks you want." And if the Warriors are aiming for Giannis, Portland’s like, "Absolutely, no problem," offering Jonathan Gaminaga and Brandon Pazipski. And yeah, I get it—that's quite a lot to juggle. The Blazers can make the move, but honestly, they’re not the ones in the driver's seat here. If any team is dead set on acquiring Giannis, they’re going to have to shell out a serious price. Milwaukee’s definitely eager to get their draft picks back—they need them back. Portland might seem to hold some leverage, but Giannis also has some power in this situation because I guess he… It’s possible he might sign that 4-year, $275 million extension next year just like he’s always planned. But this time, Giannis could genuinely be thinking, “Man, I’m not getting any younger.” If he’s serious about winning more titles, he might finally realize he needs to move on. It seems like he’s just gearing us all up for that moment. So, what about the Spurs, though? Giannis and Victor Wembanyama pairing up. Wimi has been impressive on the court during this pre-season, no doubt. But it’s really his physical transformation during the off-season that’s got the NBA on edge.
