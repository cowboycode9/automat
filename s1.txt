Up to this point, Wimby has already taken down two players in quick succession, then switched gears to a logo three, showing off his handles and a reverse dunk like he's some top-tier guard. He's making stars like AD and Zion look like kids out there. Wim and the Spurs definitely are surpassing expectations early on, and it’s pretty clear they’re ahead of where most thought they'd be. The whole NBA should be pretty nervous right now. But honestly, everything’s going so smoothly that it might actually cause some issues. De’Aaron Fox is dealing with an injury at the moment, but once he’s back in action, that could make things tricky. So, how is Wimi this much better all of a sudden? Did the Shaolin Monks train him or something? Are we on the verge of something big happening? Ever heard that NBA All-Stars do karate every summer? Yeah, spoiler alert: they don’t. But here’s something interesting—after just three games, Wimy’s chances of claiming MVP go from +400 all the way up to +310. That’s probably one of the biggest three-game shifts in betting odds we’ve ever seen. So, why didn’t anyone see this coming when it’s Wimy? Well, first off, he’s... {"annotations":[],"refusal":null,"role":"assistant"} When he first entered the league, he kind of resembled a taller Kevin Durant. Now, he’s starting to look more like Giannis. But what does that actually mean on the court? Well, think about KD—he’s all about scoring from the outside. Last year, that was Wimi, who hit nearly nine three-pointers per game. This game is more about threes than Tyler Herro, James Harden, and Trey Young combined. It’s a handy skill to have, but when you’re 76, maybe it’s better to hit the basket instead. This season, he’s more like Giannis, actually leading the NBA in dunks. The guy almost seems to be chasing contact, like he’s craving it or something. Last year, about 37% of his points came from inside the paint. Now, after four games, that number has jumped to 52%. His free throw attempts have also increased—he averaged five per game as a rookie, then four last year, and now he's at ten. What's happening? It’s like he’s a completely different player. But overall, we’ve been doing pretty well with his progress. PrizePicks just happened again. We scored two wins in a row, then almost pulled off a perfect third. But honestly, win or lose, I always jump on PrizePicks just to make watching the games more exciting. The coolest part is how simple the app is to navigate. All you really need to do is tweak a few players' stats, submit your picks, and then kick back and enjoy the games. First up, DLo—let’s lean more on his boards and assists. Next, Cedric Coward—he’s been a fun rookie to watch, so let’s go with more on his rebounds. Fingers crossed we can hit three in a row. For three, PrizePicks is accessible across a bunch of states, Texas where I’m at, California too—and lots more. If you’re signing up for the first time, make sure to use the promo code Am Hoops.

Putting 50 bucks on lineups means you could win or lose right away. That's the vibe with Playfi getting 50 Kodam hoops. He managed to do it by gaining around 30 pounds since his first year. But starting out as pretty skinny, defenders could rough him up pretty easily. Take last year, for example—the Magic switched the screen with Anthony Black, and… Black's noticeably a foot shorter. That shouldn’t be happening. He’s responsible for keeping Vic out of the paint. So when he catches the ball, just check Wimy’s toes beneath the three-point arc, which turns into a contested jump shot from way outside. The main issue used to be his strength, but now he just holds his position there. Yeah, I’m not about to push you off your game. Check out how these defenders are trying to pressure him, but they end up getting roasted. What really makes Wimby stand out, though, is his ball-handling at that size. Last year was definitely a tough one for him, but… Time slips away as he maneuvers around contact and finds his driving angles. That same movement feeds into his habit of taking those long two-point shots. First, he draws his defender out with a clever shot fake, then attempts to attack with a drive. But once he's met with solid defense and is effectively boxed out, he ends up settling for a shot instead. No one’s got a chance to slow him down now. Just check out Wimu making Anthony Davis look completely powerless. AD has been one of the top defenders for a long time, so this is wild to watch. Wimby is playing with such intensity right now. Last year, Wimi probably would’ve just pulled up and taken that three, but this time, he’s choosing to use that opportunity differently and make a move. He’s got an outside shot to start another drive, but what happens next is just wild. This play really shows why Wimby might be one of the best players out there. He’s nearly unstoppable, even with two defenders all over him. He splits the defense by zigzagging the ball between his legs, then somehow keeps his balance at 76. It’s one of those moments that just leaves you shook. Then he suddenly switches his angle, changing direction instantly. He tosses the ball behind his back, then strides forward for a gentle, effortless jumper. Seriously, no exaggeration. Only a few NBA starting guards can pull off that level of ball handling. And he's 76 years old. The game is pretty much over. I'm not kidding. If he’s able to do this at 21, just imagine what he can do now. His prime years? We might be witnessing the best player to ever handle a basketball. And that’s just on offense. We could easily make an entire video about his defense, but I just want to highlight one thing—something pretty funny, actually. So, Zion begins the game the other night… That was a crazy day with a dunk on Wimi. Oh, he was really feeling himself after that. Nice work. But honestly, that might have been the worst thing that could’ve happened to Zion. All that confidence got sparked, and he started going at Wimi. For the next few minutes, Wimi just kept blocking his shots four times in a row. It looked like Wimi was in total control. Dad’s out there in the driveway, going head-to-head with his kids. Was it the Shaolin Monks training or perhaps working with Aake? Honestly, this is what happens when you have someone as ambitious as Wimby, who’s determined to be the best. Every offseason, he’s just going to put in the work, just like Kobe did, and come back stronger. He’s really taken it to an entirely different level. The crazy part is, there are still maybe two, three, even four more levels he could climb, just because he’s so young. But what about his teammates? No matter how talented Wimi is, you can’t win a game with just one strong player. It looks like, surprisingly, a rookie is stepping up instead. Dylan Harper already has that veteran vibe about him. As the second overall draft pick, he's putting up around 15 points, grabbing five rebounds, and dishing out five assists a game. But honestly, it’s not just the numbers—his style of play feels really polished. He seems confident and in control out there, not rattled by the moment. Still, once De'Aran Fox returns, Harper’s going to find himself back on the bench because that was... The original idea was to have Harper come off the bench this season, mainly as a backup to Fox. But what if he’s already prepared to take on a bigger role? That question is prompting a lot of people to wonder if they should consider trading De’Aaron Fox. It might sound wild, but just think about it for a moment. The heart of this team is… Wimi, Dylan Harper, Stefan Castle, and two guards in the middle. Are you thinking about adding a third guard to that lineup, or would you prefer to bring in some top-tier 3-and-D players to round out the roster? As it stands, Fox is the only one sitting on a max contract. And that’s a big part of the puzzle. Winning in the NBA in 2025 really comes down to managing the salary cap smartly. Do you want a big chunk—say 30%—of your cap dedicated to a position you already have covered? Probably not. That wouldn’t make much sense. So, what’s the plan? Likely, they won’t make many moves this year. During the playoffs, though, they'd probably prefer to focus on optimizing their current roster rather than making risky changes. De'Aaron Fox is better than rookie Dylan Harper. But if we're just talking about future moves, what kind of trade could they pull off? You’ve got to consider teams that need a point guard and also have the assets to make a deal, like the Minnesota Timberwolves. Now, you might find this trade surprising. The Wolves are interested in acquiring Fox because having a top-tier point guard like him instantly boosts their chances of competing. The proposed deal gives the Wolves Fox in exchange for Jada McDaniels, Dante Danchinszo, and Jaylen Clark, mainly to balance salaries. No draft picks involved, just players. McDaniels is widely regarded as one of the best defenders in the league. Spurs Bring Devenzo into the mix—he’s a pure shooter, which is exactly what they need. The thing is, no picks are part of this deal because Fox is the real star here, and he’s definitely the key piece. But here’s the catch: Fox is going to be making fifty million a year down the line. Not many teams are ready to shell out that kind of cash, so this trade doesn’t seem to be shaping up as likely. Hey, so what do you think about all these rumors about Li Markin? Wouldn’t it be awesome if they paired him up in a three-team trade to swap Fox’s hefty contract for Li Markin? Either way, it feels like the Spurs should start to ramp up their efforts now because Wimby’s window of opportunity is wide open. You never really know how long it will stay like this, especially for someone like Wimi, because his health is always the big question mark. I hate to bring it up, but at some point, the only thing that could really take him out of the game are injuries. It’s pretty un-Spurslike to see it come to that. When you’re throwing all your chips in and going all-in, it’s a bold strategy, but when you’ve got someone like Victor Wembanyama on your team, all those usual rules fly right out the window. A report mentioned that what might have driven Wimby more than anything else this off-season was the fact that Chad Holmgren took home a win. Before him, there was the championship title. And if there's one guy Wimbledon really wants to defeat, it's Chad. This rivalry goes way back to their teenage days. So, here’s a look at Wimby’s legendary rookie season and how his competitive streak with Chad first started.
