So, Mark Cuban has been standing firmly in support of Kawhi Leonard and Steve Ballmer throughout the entire investigation. But what's his reason? From the very beginning, he was quick to say, “I'm on Team Ballmer.” However, as the evidence started piling up showing that the Clippers secretly paid Kawhi under the table to violate NBA rules, Cuban's stance only grew more unyielding. It’s almost like he’s secretly getting paid off the books by the Clippers too. But after he and Pablo Tori had yet another Twitter back-and-forth about this, Pablo actually spilled the beans aloud. Hey, Mark, I’ve got a question for you. Why are you even doing this? I mean, you’re running a bunch of different businesses, so what’s the point? He's a guy who’s always on the go. So why are you wasting so much time defending Steve Ballmer when nobody else seems to be bothering? Pablo might not be able to say this, but I will. Did Mark Cuban secretly strike similar off-the-record deals with Durk back in the day? When you think about it, there’s definitely something to consider. The whole situation is crazy. Or maybe there's another explanation, but honestly, it feels even more suspicious than that. First off, does Cuban really have a valid point? Not really. However, I have to admit, there’s one part of his argument that makes me and think. And if any of you... Sure, I can help with that. Here's a rewritten version with a natural, conversational tone while keeping all the details intact: Can you give me an answer to this? Alright, so here’s Cuban’s theory. After that, I’ll explain why he’s actually defending Balmer in the first place. We’ve got about a month left until the NBA season kicks off. Until then, Prize Picks is the go-to spot to win cash while enjoy watching sports, especially the NFL. The coolest part is that their app makes building a lineup super simple. All you need to do is adjust a few player stats by choosing more or less. For instance, this week I’m leaning towards Tony Pard, especially focusing on his rushing yards, and I’m also including a college player named… Reggie Virgil didn't rack up as many receiving yards as some might have expected. By the way, if you're only interested in one of my picks, I’ll admit I take that pretty personally. But just so you know, this week’s biggest discount is on Patrick Mahomes. All he needs to do is toss for more than half a yard, and you’re good to go. And it's a sure thing. PrizePicks is available in 45 states, including Texas and California. If you put in just $5, you’ll get $50 worth of lineups right away. Win or lose, use the code AMHOOPS. That's Play Five, and you get $50 in lineups immediately. Code AMHOOPS. So, from the very beginning, Cuban mentioned, I’m with Team Balmer. And he’s got a reason ready for why Balmer is innocent. First off, he says, Balmer wouldn’t be stupid enough to let Aspiration go under. If he did, the proof would come out, and everyone would see he’s guilty. All right, I get that. But the real hanging question is, why? Pay Kawaii millions for a no-show deal? Cuban's got a response for that. His point is that Aspiration paid $300 million over 23 years to sponsor the Clippers. The deal's value drops if the Clippers don't perform well. So, keeping Kawaii around on the Clippers actually helps your own interests. Sponsorships. And yeah, that’s pretty weak at best. But what about that payment from Dennis Wong? Balmer’s friend mysteriously shells out two million dollars right around the same time Kawi receives his own roughly two million dollar payment. The timing is truly shocking. Unless you’re Mark Cuban, of course. The fact that they turned to Dennis for this? Definitely raises some eyebrows. Wong and his daughter managed to raise $2 million there, so that’s likely the link. The company was really struggling financially, losing money rapidly. I often get emails or calls from folks saying, “Hey, Mark, I’m about to raise a significant amount of money, but I…” I need a bridge loan to get me through until the new funds arrive. And that’s exactly what happened with this Dennis Wong situation. Seriously, it feels like a total coincidence. The whole thing was just a bridge loan arranged by Dennis Wong’s daughter, who was working there. Like I mentioned, that’s the explanation. That's not really true. But one thing Cuban did say that made me stop and think a bit was when he made fun of Pablo Tori's timeline. Cuban pointed out that Kawai only received his initial $3.5 million payment several months after the first deal was made, and he only got paid then. Again, after Aspiration got another round of funding, I was thinking—if the idea was to use Bulmer's 50 million to settle with Kawaii, then why are there late payments? The timeline really doesn’t add up, and that’s definitely a valid point. So, why is Cuban so eager to defend this situation so aggressively? The clips are out there, and it just doesn’t make sense. Definitely guilty. A lot of folks are skeptical about some shady deals involving Dirk Nitzky. Maybe Cuban is backing Balmer because he was involved in something similar. You see, Dirk accepted discounts totaling up to $194 million during his time with the Dallas Mavericks. Just to be clear, I’m a big Dirk fan—I really am. He's... A total badass. He's an assassin on the field. Off the field, he's pretty humble, but there's no denying he's a winner. This isn’t a slight against Derk at all. I really do respect him as a player, but the thing is, dude took four huge pay cuts while he was with Dallas. Most big-name stars wouldn’t do that, especially someone at his level. This guy's like… The top 15, 20 all-time list. The first player to make it was in 2006, when he still had two years remaining on his rookie extension. Durk decided to sign a new three-year deal instead, worth 59 million dollars. If he hadn’t accepted that offer, he would have been eligible for a six-year deal worth 158 million in 2008. His next contract extension was supposed to be five years for $239 million back in 2014. But instead, he only signed a three-year deal for $25 million in 2014. Wait, what? And at that time, other teams were reportedly offering him max contracts. That offseason, both the Rockets and Lakers reached out to Durk with max offers, and he… Nobody said otherwise. Houston had built up Dwight Howard with James Harden and young Chandler Parsons. They had the funds and the competitiveness to be a real title contender. It’s a bit strange, though. Later on, Howard signed two more short, inexpensive contracts to finish his career. Those two max contract offers he never accepted added up to a total of 446 million by the end of his playing days. In 2019, his actual income was 252 million, which was 194 million less than he could have earned. Why was that? Well, that money was strategically used to help the Mavericks create a strong and competitive team, making it easier to sign other free agents to surround him. The Mavericks were almost always a contender, and their championship win in 2011 was thanks to this approach. Durk's skills and the discounts he gets. But is it out of the question to believe Cuban could have hidden some extra incentives, like hush-money or a future job offer after he retires? Not really. Cuban was known for bending the rules all the time as an owner. So people often wonder, "Hey, do you think the NBA would still..." Would they penalize the Mavericks if they discovered they sidestepped the cap with Dirk Nitzky? No, Cuban isn’t concerned about that. The team now has new majority owners, so punishing them isn’t really on the table. And honestly, nobody’s been questioning why Dirk left that money on the table until now. So, Cuban just speaking out like this... That would actually be hurting himself. The real story is probably way more underhanded. Do you remember what Cuban said about Donald Sterling when all that controversy was going on? The former Clippers owner was caught on tape expressing racist views about Magic Johnson just because he's black. It was pretty straightforward and blatant racism. People were wearing shirts demanding that Sterling be banned, which is completely understandable. In this country, Cuban, people have the right to be idiots. They can be foolish, think ridiculous things, and say whatever they want. But when it comes to just issuing a blanket, let's kick him out rule, I... I don’t want to get too caught up in it because it’s not really about Donald. It’s not about his role or status. It’s about who’s coming next. That’s what matters. Cuban believed I could easily be the one to step into that. Dune, on the other hand, was recognized as kind of the rebellious NBA owner. He was always in conflict with the... He used to be deeply involved in the league, and if he ever ran into trouble, he wanted the other owners to rally around him. But now that he's no longer even a majority owner, does it really matter? Still, having Steve Ballmer as a friend is incredibly valuable. I mean, can you even picture the first moment those guys realize that? Are you and D. Bomber close? He's about to give him the biggest hug ever. Say something like, "Thanks for having my back in public right from the start. You really stepped up when no one else did. I owe you." For sure. We already know that Cuban is ready to step in and take action. Unpopular opinions like what we saw with Donald Sterling—even if it damages his public image—show that having strong friends and connections really pays off. It works to his advantage. I bet he looked at this situation and thought, "Hey, never waste a good crisis," which, in a weird way, is pretty clever. Oh, he’d never do something like that. Why not? I always saw Mark Cuban as a basketball guy first, and then he sold the Mavericks. You wouldn’t expect him to do something like that. Why? Because Cuban understood when the timing was right to sell. From a business perspective, valuations are getting pretty inflated right now. That’s why he went with dollars instead of crunching the numbers. Never imagined he’d do that, honestly. He’s a true business guy through and through. Does he believe Steve Ballmer is actually innocent? Probably not. But he does recognize that Ballmer is the ninth richest person in the world. He's really going to owe him big time, and it didn't cost Mark Cuban a thing. Quite the smart move, if you ask me. On the topic of money being offered, Austin Reeves recently declined a $90 million extension with the Lakers to take a shot at himself. There’s a real good chance this gamble could pay off for him. But what do you think? So, will the Lakers meet his asking price? What if another team steps in and offers him around 35 million dollars? Is Austin Reeves really worth that kind of money? It makes you wonder, what's the likelihood that this will be Reeves' last season in a Lakers jersey?
