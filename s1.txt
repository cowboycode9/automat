The NBA's brutal—Kevin Durant had to sit there watching his former team hang a banner on opening night. Every possession with his new team felt like a punch in the gut. But it all got even tougher. At the end of regulation, KD lines up for free throws, with a shot to put the Rockets ahead by three. The tension’s thick. There’s some room to finish the game, and KD misses his free throw. Clutch shooting, he went 90% from the line, but this time he only makes one out of two. Naturally, SGA takes advantage and sends the game into overtime. But at the end of the extra period, KD tries to call a timeout, even though Houston already had none left. That’s an obvious technical foul for OKC. To come out on top, nope. OKC goes absolutely wild, rightfully so. They had a real shot at winning. But then SGA finally tricks KD with a pump fake, making him bite hard. Gets the call, draws the foul. And that's pretty much the end of it. Durant seemed almost like he wanted to lose that game, and somehow, he managed to pull it off. But wait a second. If the Rockets ended up losing to OKC because of Kevin Durant, in a way, that’s actually a positive. He’s now part of a squad where he doesn’t have to be the top scorer or even the second-best player every night. It’s wild to think about, but this guy has managed to connect himself with an elite young team, despite getting close to 40. Amin Thompson definitely stepped into a new league. Alperin Chenon dropped 39 points, grabbed 11 rebounds, and dished out seven assists after steering Turkey to a silver at EuroBasket. So, does that Euro game carry over this year? Absolutely. I’m not saying it’s quite the same as Golden State, but just imagine all the... Since leaving Steph and the Warriors, Durant has been on a pretty wild ride with his team choices. First, there was the Brooklyn Nets, full of chaos and drama, with KD shining as the star. Then he moved to the Suns, who basically tore apart their roster just to bring him in. By the time KD finally lands in Phoenix, they've already dismantled a whole lot of what made the team click. So, is this finally the right fit for him? That championship team was impressive, but Houston almost took down the reigning champs even with KD not at his best. They’ve got a steady organization and a solid front office running the show. If KD manages to actually win a title as a Rocket, it would completely flip the script. It’s like Durk defeating LeBron in 2011 or Jokić clinching one in 2023—life-changing for legacy talk. Talking championships, KD’s situation is pretty interesting. Outside of Golden State, not many folks really give him credit for those two rings he won there. If he pulls off a win with Houston at age 37, that would seriously elevate his legacy into the top 10 all time. But the real question is, can they actually make it happen? Seems like everyone has been pretty hyped about My lately. I really love Fit Foods because My Fit Foods is how I stay in shape all year without feeling restricted or bored with my diet. They keep things exciting by introducing new meals every month, so there’s always something fresh to try. Trust me, I’ve tested out nearly a hundred different options, and it never gets old.

Now, with the news about KD taking a pay cut, everything shifts. Instead of opting for his max deal of two years totaling 120 million, he settled for just 90 million. Yeah, only 90 million. I mean, it’s pretty surprising, right? Look, LeBron is still the highest-paid player of all time, but that kind of thing doesn’t happen often. He always talks about wanting to win, but when it really counted, he chose to take three million less. And remember, he's a billionaire. KD did the same, taking thirty million less. That shows real dedication because he’s willing to sacrifice a lot for the team. He understands what this is really about, right? All the critics, everyone questioning his rings and the Golden State dominance—those doubts evaporate when he steps up like this. So, he commits to giving back 15 million a year. Do you have any idea what kind of player Houston could land with that kind of money? This is a glimpse at the players who earn that kind of salary. They’re bringing in about 15 million a year. Names like Daniel Gaffford, Denny Via, Austin Reeves, Herb Jones—these guys would all definitely add to a championship run. And even though the Rockets played pretty well, they definitely need that kind of contribution. The key takeaway for the Rockets is clear: losing Fred Van Vleet to injury really makes a difference. They’re really needing a point guard right now. Maybe it’s Reed Shepard. But not yet. Coach Udoka mostly kept this kid on the bench all last year. Then, just before the first game, Shepard drops 29 points in the preseason against the Hawks starters. Udoka’s response? “That’s nice, but you’re still coming off the bench.” Why? Because he… So, he’s not really a true point guard, and his defense isn’t great either. So, what’s the point of all this, honestly? People thought that snagging Kevin Durant on the cheap would be a game-changer for their problems. Last year, the Rockets were basically one of the worst shooting teams out there, which didn’t help. In the NBA, they landed in the 20s when it came to three-point makes, attempts, and shooting percentage, and that really hurt them during the playoffs. The Rockets shot 5 for 17 in their game against Golden State, which led to their elimination. When working in the half court, Houston managed only 78 points per 100 possessions in their half-court offense. To give some perspective, Charlotte was… They're sitting at the bottom of the NBA standings. Their offense is ranking at just 90 points per 100 possessions, which is even worse than the league’s worst team. So, yeah, they're really struggling right now. The idea was for Katie to turn things around, but without a true point guard, it's been tough. Sure, there were moments against OKC that looked okay, but honestly, we've never had a solid, consistent playmaker running the show. You’ve got a champion team, but they’re missing a true point guard to really push them over the edge. If they want to take home the title, Houston’s got to make a move on the trade front. The silver lining? They still have plenty of assets to work with, because for some reason, the Suns were pretty eager to offload KD. Yeah. People were thinking, "For a player of all-time caliber, they’re probably going to have to give up one of their top young stars." But in reality, all they needed to part with were Jaylen Green, who was the 10th pick, Dylan Brooks, and some seconds. They didn’t even touch a lot of the other assets they had, like Control the. The Sun owned the 27th and 29th overall picks in the draft, so there was a moment when the Rockets had their eyes on Giannis — but that’s all behind us now. Now’s the time to really push all-in while the opportunity’s there. So, who should they be aiming for? Well, number one on that list has to be Derek White. He’s… The new Drew Holiday in Boston has everyone talking, but is there any chance the Celtics would part with him? It’d probably take a massive return, but hey, it’s worth a shot. White seems like a perfect match for what Boston needs. And if the Rockets are approaching a rebuild, White’s the kind of player that could really push a team over the edge. So, what do you think? The Rockets land White and Jordan Walsh to balance out Dorian Finney-Smith, Reed Shepard, Clint Capella, and that championship-caliber 2027 unprotected Suns first-round pick, which is one of the most sought-after assets in the league. Boston would be foolish to ignore an offer like that. But the real question is, why would the Rockets make this deal? Because they’re… Take a gamble that that pick ends up outside the top two in this new lottery setup. If it lands lower, the team probably won’t have space for some hot shot rookie anyway—they’d trade him off eventually. So, why not make that move now and bundle it for a guy like White? Who’s really good at putting the pieces together and boosting KD’s game? Reed Shepard might have promise, but he’s not quite there yet. He got hunted on defense all night. Next up is Andrew Nimhard from the Pacers. He’s a true starting point guard on a championship-contending team, making an impact on both offense and defense. Coochi Mudoka is really into Nimhard’s versatility, but pulling him away wouldn’t be simple since Indie has a real fondness for Nimhard. So, Houston steps up aggressively. They’re pushing hard for Reed Shepard, Tari Eason, Jeff Green, and even that deal involving the Brooklyn Nets. Once again, the Rockets come in with a big, almost unstoppable offer, and Indie finds himself pretty hard-pressed to say no. They just can’t resist saying yes, but the reason they do it is because Reed has to be part of the trade since the Pacers are in need of a point guard. I’ve also heard that the talks for a new deal for Tari E are way off from being finalized. And that swap involving the Nets might involve a high pick in the lottery. Now, some other… I've heard a few names tossed around as potential options for point guard, like Drew Holiday, CJ McCullum, and Pton Pritchard. But honestly, I think the only real contenders worth going all-in on are Derek White and Andrew Nimhard. The issue with Drew is that he's a bit too advanced in age, and even if they managed to get a solid season out of him, there are questions about how sustainable that would be moving forward. If they season him off him, his massive contract would blow up the last two years. CJ McCollum isn’t great on defense, and they already have their scoring covered. Pritchard is the kind of player you'd hope Reed Shepard could become after a few seasons, but they already have Shepard and he’s just not quite that level yet. So, can this... Does the KD thing actually work? Absolutely, we just watched it in action during game one, where the defending champs were pushed to the edge even though KD wasn’t at his best. That’s why being on this team is such a smart move—if KD gets sidelined later on in his 30s because of injuries, the rest of the roster is capable of carrying the load. But... That pay cut he took might be the key to pushing them over the edge with just one more move. KD made that call because he’s aware that if this gamble pays off, it’ll change the game entirely. Meanwhile, LaMelo B has some weight on him heading into this season. The whole NBA is zeroing in on him now. A little preseason action, and the spotlight’s already brightest on him. Right now, LaMelo is ranked below some role players, which seems harsh. But is that a fair assessment? I decided to do a deep dive into his game to see where he really stands. Check it out and decide for yourself if the critics are on point or missing the mark before he hits his sixth year with the Hornets.
