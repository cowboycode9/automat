The Mavericks are really messing up Cooper Flags rookie year, and it's starting to take a toll on him. Honestly, I feel like it's the worst losing streak he's ever experienced. It’s not fun to watch. The kid's got the skills to make defenders stumble and look silly—it's obvious. The year just seems to be flying by. The Mads are looking worse than ever—they just got knocked off by the Pelicans, who didn’t even have Zion, and now they’re sitting comfortably at the bottom of the West. And it’s not like their schedule’s been brutal or anything. The Mavs kicked things off with five home games, and they’ve only actually been on the road once, yet they’re still racking up losses. Isn't that something? The Pelicans and Wizards are both at home, but things aren’t looking good for either team. How did it come to this? And should we be concerned about Cooper Flag’s performance? Playing point guard might not be his strong suit right now, but Jason Kidd saw potential. Once Kyrie Irving returns, Coupe could step in as a secondary playmaker, thanks to all the point guard skills he's developing. That’s a solid plan, but there’s one catch. You can’t really screw around in the West. If you start experimenting, before you know it, you’ll be stuck in last place, fighting just to make the play-in. The real kicker for Cooper is that his teammates just can’t hit their shots. The Mavericks are at the bottom of the league when it comes to three-pointers. Klay Thompson's career seems pretty much done at this point. He's averaging just eight points a game, which is the lowest he's ever scored in his career. His three-point shooting is also at an all-time low. The Warriors’ offense, led by Cooper Flags, is sitting at the very bottom of the NBA rankings. There are a bunch of ugly stats, but what really surprised me the most was something else. Still, I’ve had a blast... playing prize. This season’s picks are coming in hot. The schedule is really filling up, especially on those nights when we have six, seven, eight, or even more games. It’s always a thrill to make some predictions and treat every night like it’s playoff time, even during the regular season. And honestly, my favorite part about it all is… The app is super straightforward when it comes to making picks. All you really have to do is choose whether a player will go over or under on certain stats. Tonight, I’m starting with Kesan Wallace — I’m leaning towards more on his three-point attempts. Then, I’m taking Ryan Kulkrunner to go lower on his stats. It’s a simple process and a pretty user-friendly way to make your guesses. PointsBet and Boards are both available in 45 states, including California and Texas, where I happen to live. If you're signing up for the first time, using the code AM hoops really supports the channel. When you put in five bucks, that code can turn into 50 bucks worth of lineups. It happens instantly—win or lose. That’s how it goes with the Play 5 Get 50K code and hoops compared to the rest of the NBA. The Mavericks’ offense is minus 11.4, meaning they’re scoring 11.4 points less than the league average. But just how bad is that? It’s actually three points worse than Dallas’s worst-ever offensive season. The 93 Mavs, who only managed 11 wins, seem like they’re doing better than the current Mavs, who are worse than that. And if it wasn’t bad enough that they’re playing like a ‘90s offense, take a look at this. By League Average stats, the Mavs today are playing more like a 1970s NBA team. That’s the reality right now. That’s what you get when you give the keys to an 18-year-old who’s never even played the position before. So, how did the Mavs end up putting him in such a tough spot? When Kyrie Irving got injured, it was obvious they needed a reliable point guard. But all Nico Harrison could come up with was… D'Angelo Russell spent the entire off-season working on his game, and this is what he showed for it. Honestly, there’s a reason why DLO was with the Nets last year and no one else picked him up. Yet, while everyone’s watching Luka take over the NBA, folks were questioning a different move with Nico. How could they? So, why didn’t we end up trading Austin Reeves for that Luca deal? Honestly, Reeves would’ve been a huge help handling the ball right now. But it looks like reports are saying Nico also fumbled that one. The trade was basically Luca for Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a pick. That trade was just terrible. Luca should’ve demanded everything, like, everything not nailed down. I mean all the picks, maybe even toss in a couple of Lakers trophies just for kicks. But according to The Athletic, Nico was worried the deal might get leaked. So when Rob Pela reached out to talk with Luca, Nico... No one said anything. Since they couldn’t really judge how committed Luca was to staying in LA for the long haul, the Lakers basically threw up their hands and said, "Well, you can’t go all-in for him." The Mavericks, on the other hand, responded, "Of course you can. I understand where you’re coming from." In the end, the Lakers decided to hold onto their 2031 first-round pick. Austin Reeves. That’s how the Lakers, with zero leverage, managed to pull a fast one on the Mavericks, all because Nico Harrison is dead set on Anthony Davis. The guy was convinced that a 32-year-old, injury-prone AD was a better bet than a 26-year-old Luka Doncic hitting his prime. It’s kind of like the Bucks trading Giannis right before he hit superstar status, just wild. He racks up two MVP awards in a row while winning a ring. Oh, and they actually traded him for Kevin Love. But none of that feels fair. We haven't even gotten to see Nico's full potential yet. AD and Kyrie are hurt, yeah, but that’s just how it goes sometimes. They often get injured; it’s kind of just part of the deal. So, it's not really an excuse, right? I mean, if Nicole Yogic got injured, sure, maybe people would sympathize a bit. But if you're trading for Anthony Davis or Joel Embiid, nobody’s feeling sorry for you. It’s not a valid excuse. The frustrating part is, these fans can’t even recognize when Cooper Flags does something impressive. Great game. He likely had his best night of the year so far during the matchup with New Orleans, but because of the circumstances, folks are feeling down. If this had been the Jazz, everyone would be celebrating. They’d be saying, "Nice work, looking ahead to what’s next." Instead, with the Mavs, it’s a different vibe. They have no future and are just watching their star player crush it with the Lakers. Luca has this Michael Jordan-like knack for taking things personally. How did Nico not see that coming? Honestly, this is the same guy Devin Booker once trash-talked, isn’t it? So, in a way, Luca ended up ruining his game. The whole franchise took a hit that game. In Game 7, Luca dominated so hard that the new owner, Matt SB, was so embarrassed he ended up trading away the entire championship roster, destroying the team in the process. That’s the power of Luca’s trash talk. So, what do you think he’s going to do to Nico Harrison? Luca’s already broken him. When he found out about the trade, he grabbed his phone. A report said he broke down and cried. We definitely saw him wipe away a tear when he got back to Dallas and watched that tribute video. Now, Luca's going to make it pretty clear that Nico screwed up. At the moment, Luca’s just hovering and clearly upset. Sha's really making a case for MVP. The Lakers are sitting at 7 and 2, averaging 40 points a game, and Sha’s doing all that without LeBron James, who’s still a top 10 player. And the kicker? The Lakers picked him up for nothing, didn’t even have to part ways with Austin Reeves, who could be an all-star someday. Oh, and the reason Nico… I wasn’t really into Luca because of all the conditioning and injury worries. But then he trades for a guy literally named Street Clothes, who had already been hurt at the start of the season. You can’t make this stuff up. If you put it in a movie script, everyone would be like, “Whoa, yeah, no, that’s too fake. Take that out.” No one really thought that was going to happen. But it did. So, the question is, why hasn't Nico been fired? It looks like that might never happen after all. The new owners actually trust Nico, and now their entire reputation depends on this trade being successful. They’re willing to see it through rather than risk losing face. Sticking with Nico rather than trading him away seems like the move to make. But if you're the new GM, what’s the game plan? Honestly, the first step would probably be to hang tight until AD is back to full health, build his value up, and then look to trade him. The main reason is the Mavericks don’t have control over their own pick until 2031, except for this one exception. Alright, so if you’re trading AD, it means you’re OK with throwing this season’s last pick under the bus to help out Coupe in a stacked draft. After that, you get more picks to start rebuilding. Maybe that’s their quiet plan—tank using the only draft pick they’ll have for a good chunk of time. Now, They could never pitch that idea to their own fans. So instead, they end up undermining their own season from within. Not bringing in a replacement for Kyrie? Just let Cooper Flag handle the playmaking and aim for a top draft pick. But hey, that’s just a conspiracy theory, right? Without any picks in the draft, things look pretty grim. Just consider what the Spurs have pulled off with Victor Wembanyama. They selected rookie of the year candidate Steph Castle at number four, then went with Dylan Harper at number two, and also made some nice draft picks for De’Aaron Fox. Meanwhile, Cooper has Kyrie Irving on a two-year deal in a "win now" mindset. So, it looks like Nico might be on his way out. Down with the ship—that’s the team Cooper Flag was drafted onto. Honestly, it might be the unluckiest number one pick of all time. And speaking of that, what about his growth? Some top picks get lucky and land with seasoned veteran point guards, or players they can develop slowly. Others, like the Mavericks, toss an 18-year-old straight into a major role with high expectations, a lot of pressure, and not much time to ease in. He’s never actually had the chance to play, stuck on a team filled with veterans who either can’t hit their shots or are hurt, and everyone’s expecting to win right now. That kind of pressure doesn’t build confidence; it breeds bad habits instead. I feel bad for him. Between the pressure he's under, his teammates, and the uncertain future, this might be the worst situation a number one pick could find themselves in. Have you ever thought about Cooper Flag’s situation? At just 18, he's stepping into a spot where he needs to perform now—help the team win alongside AD and Kyrie—while also carrying the weight of the franchise’s future on his shoulders. Even if he’s truly a once-in-a-generation talent, it's still going to be a tough path to navigate. Him trying to sort out this chaos with the Dallas Mavericks is one thing, but the situation in Memphis is totally different. It seems like they’ve got a solid franchise but a star player who's causing some trouble. Right now, there’s a major clash happening between John and his coach. The coach is trying to be brutally honest about everything. So, with Jaw, it didn’t go as planned. Now, we’re left wondering—are the Grizzlies still on Jaw’s side, or have they shifted toward his new coach?
