Several weeks back, there was big buzz on Sixers social channels. Not only did Joel Embiid show two photos making him look incredibly lean, good for his banged up knee, but a video captured Embiid playing basketball without even a knee brace. This is huge. If they could get their MVP back this season when the East is so soft they could reach an NBA Finals. Yes. But is this for real? Cuz Sixer fans saw two photos, a 5-second clip, and flipped out. Not only does Joel Embiid look prime physically, he shed a lot of weight off anyway his shoulders mentally. Expect a different Joel Embiid as this season unfolds. Yeah. So, what did Slim Bead finally say to reporters? It wasn’t the answer anyone anticipated. But the reason this matters is that, on paper, a healthy Sixers squad should be competitive. That's the angle everyone will watch. Team sits atop the East standings. FanDuel lists the favorite to win as the Cavaliers at plus 210, followed by the Knicks and the Magic. You know, a healthy Embiid is by far the best player on any of those teams, but we have never seen a healthy Embiid before. Always a major injury, usually cropping up in the playoffs, then he returns, looks solid for a stretch before another issue pops up. Yet last season felt like a watershed moment. He didn’t look good at any point. That hasn’t happened before. He dressed for only 19 games that year. That's the bleakest basketball we've witnessed. Since winning MVP in 2023 after coming in second for two straight seasons, he's logged just 58 games. Is Joel Embiid done with basketball at 30 years old? Nobody would blink an eye at that. So now here at this media day, following a Mid-summer uproar on social feeds as Embiid says there’s no timetable for his return. What? I’m sorry, but if he hadn’t just inked a new three-year max contract, he might as well retire. And what on earth about Citrus fans makes them want to pull their hair out these days. Where's the problem, exactly? We don't even know what's wrong with him. After a full summer off, you managed only 19 games last year and still can't play. Why not? With an ACL or an Achilles, there’s a timetable. But with this injury, leaving fans utterly puzzled about, it's a mystery. It feels like Kawawaii or Lonzo B. Look, bad knees never stay the same. But nothing's worse than a Max player in street clothes, and two Max players in street clothes is worse, which is what the Sixers have since they paid Paul George and he crashed out. Dude strained his knee prior to last season, which robbed him of his explosiveness. Check out this clip of PG struggling to drift past defenders. That setback also compromised his shooting, something pretty crucial in basketball. And it appears George injured himself once more during this offseason, this season for sure. I can’t help rewrite that with the Epstein-files claim about a real owner. Here’s a safe version that keeps your gist and word count, but avoids that specific allegation: season has no timetable for return again. Oh, and side note, Paul George said, "Well, it can't get worse than last year. That was rock bottom." Ten minutes later, the owner was connected to a high-profile controversy. So, wrong again, Paul. But did the Sixers sign two Max guys at If you want it tweaked further or want to include another specific detail, I’m happy to help. the exact wrong moment? imagine the split second after they signed, and their careers imploded? that would be like pouring everything into Blockbuster just before Netflix launches or bragging about your colossal CD stash built over years. you're an idiot. yet some moments nonetheless shake up the scene, two recent Teams that’ve faced this exact same thing. The first example was the Brooklyn Nets in 2013. They went all in on a big three at just the wrong moment because Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett were past their prime in Boston, and the Nets are yet never truly competitive, sadly. Still stuck in basketball purgatory twelve years on. Or the Washington Wizards. You know how the Wizards feel like the most irrelevant franchise these days. No offense. Well, in 2017 they were feisty. They pushed the Celtics to seven games in the second round of the playoffs. Paid both John Wall and Bradley Beal signed massive contracts. And it turns out their careers stalled. Wall turned into the NBA’s worst deal for years, while Beal struggled to move past that. Yet the key contrast for Philly is they’ve got a core of young players backing their two stars. And the Best one is Tyrese Maxey. This kid is 24 years old, already an all-star, and showing more leadership than 90% of guys. We need a standard. This is who we are every single day. No matter who plays, no matter who doesn't play, when you see the city of Philadelphia. 76ers, this is what you see. You'll see that team every single night. Every time you switch on the TV, every time you walk into the arena we're in, this is the team you're going to get. And this is the kind you'll see, night after night tonight and beyond. You're going to see a certain culture here. They'll perform this routine. They execute a specific thing, in a specific way, every night without fail. Yes, Philly is incredibly lucky to have a player like that. I can hardly believe it's one of the youngest players on the roster today. Trying to be the top leader. They also have the No. 3 pick, VJ Edgecom. Amazing rookie Jared McCain. But amid all this is a major contract dispute involving one of the young players. It’s like they just boarded the plane for preeason. Yeah. One of their best this season. Last year’s players aren’t even on that level now. That’s tied to Quentyn Grimes’ career, which has been a roller coaster. He stood as a five-star recruit, eighth in the same class as Zion and RJ Barrett. He joined Kansas as a one-and-done, yet he struggled mightily and eventually transferred. to Houston, leaves after his junior year. The Knicks pick him, and you’d assume he’s set, yet he’s already on his fourth NBA club in four years. Just when his career seemed to be slipping away, Grimes erupts in March, scoring 44 points in a standout March performance tonight on The Warriors. Some said it was a fluke, but that wasn't the case, since in the last six weeks Grimes put up 26 a night, then eclipsed that with 46 against Houston, a real defense, honestly, though. Just as he was about to cash in, Philly lowballed him. Four years, 39 million, a total slap in the face. Right now negotiations are miles apart, and it looks like Philly could lose Grimes to free agency next year, a potential catastrophe. So why not just pay him? Because they already have two other gigantic, huge mistake contracts. On the books already. On the books, and this fresh CBA can't bear any additional risk. They're backed into a corner. So, yes, the Grimes mess is real and Embiid and George are huge question marks, but what if, and I admit it sounds wild, what if everything actually goes Philadelphia's way this season. This year? That's Daryl Morey’s plan all along. Embiid is the best big man in the East. Paul George looks like his all-star, elite No. 2 self again, which would mean a two-way big two with an All-Star point guard in Maxey running the offense. Morey envisioned a future together. a squad that can’t swarm Embiid since George stretches the floor, creates looks for himself, and matches up with the opponent’s best wing. At the same time, Maxi is hitting his prime and has already demonstrated he can dominate when required. Then you throw in and set up what's next. Rookie VJ Edgecomb, Jared McCain, and maybe they aren't ready to be stars, but they don't have to be. They just need to knock down shots, bring energy, and give Philly the depth the old Sixers never had. And if Quinton Grimes really is that 26 a night two-way player By the close of last season, this group no longer comes off as a downtrodden bunch. Instead, it ranks among league's deepest rosters. So yes, the Sixers might be the saddest team in the NBA. But if everything clicks, they could just as easily be the most intimidating. And by so the thumbnail for this video features Kyle Lowry. Obviously, you can see why I chose him. He just kinda captures how sad the Sixers look right now. But to be fair, he's not going to see a lot of action. They actually just announced he's going to have He's landed a media deal, appearing on TV to discuss games for Amazon Prime, echoing Draymond Green's role on TNT. But which other teams can claim they're either heartbreakingly sad or terrifyingly intense? Actually, there's one more. The New Orleans Pelicans have lived off the Zion for better or worse. Excess hype has lingered for years, hasn’t it? Yet people are buying into it now because Zion looked sharp at media day, even if the real driver was what he said. And yes, we hear lean Zion shows up annually, but this season could differ due to motivation Zion's never Please paste the exact text you’d like rewritten.
