The Ace Bailey controversy was perhaps the biggest story during the draft, second only to the Mads Landing Cooper flag. This young player was expected to be a down-to-earth guy, humble and modest, but just before the draft he started carrying himself like an arrogant diva. However, behind the scenes, it wasn’t actually Ace Bailey. It turned out… It seems like Omar Cooper, who was Ace Bailey’s manager, was secretly pulling the strings. This might have cost Ace millions of dollars and possibly damaged his reputation too. But now, it turns out Ace has actually fired Omar Cooper. And there’s a possibility this could be part of a crazy conspiracy that makes the whole scandal way darker and more twisted than everyone thought. So Ace met... Omar made the move from Tennessee to Georgia so his son could play high school basketball at Mckitan. But Mckitan isn’t your average high school—it’s a national powerhouse. Back in 2019, when Omar's son Sheree Cooper attended, the school was ranked number one in the country. Because of that, Omar kind of steps into a gatekeeping role in the scene. That’s the Georgia to NBA pipeline in action. But unfortunately for Share, things took a turn for the worse after high school. My go-to way to stay in shape is just squeezing in some workouts whenever I can. But I’m pretty strict about my diet too. What I’ve realized is that for me, about 90% of staying in shape is all about consistency and discipline. When it comes to my diet, I prioritize convenience, affordability, and, above all, flavor. My Fit Foods has really worked well for me. A bunch of you have messaged saying you love them too. They offer pre-made meals that are ready in just a short time. It only takes a couple of minutes, and their selection is huge, so I never find myself getting bored. Plus, it’s a win for the channel if you take a moment to check them out and use my discount code AMH25 to get 25% off your first purchase. They have locations all over Texas. You might even be able to walk into a store nearby. You can find their stores in Portland or Denver now, with more opening soon. I've tried so many meal prep spots over the years, but honestly, My Fit Foods stands out as the absolute best I've come across. I really recommend giving them a look. Oh, and don’t forget, the discount code is AMH25. He attends Auburn as a... He’s a five-star recruit, but he couldn’t hit the court for the first 12 games because the NCAA was looking into him for allegedly getting improper benefits and having contact with an agent. Eventually, he gets cleared and finally gets to play the last 12 games at Auburn. During those games, he put up 20 points, but he shot only 23% from three-point range—that’s not exactly impressive. Naturally, with those numbers and the drama, every expert is telling him to… She heads back to school, trying to strengthen her draft position. But nope, Sheree enters the draft and ends up sliding all the way into the second round. She plays a few games with Atlanta before heading overseas to China. From being a five-star recruit to the Far East, all while her dad Omar is calling the shots behind the scenes. Even so, Ace still relies on this guy to handle his career as his manager. But what exactly does a manager do? A lot of folks say Omar’s his agent, but that’s not really the case. A manager is someone an athlete trusts to look out for their best interests and help steer their life choices—things like school endorsements, media appearances, and overall career direction. Figuring out who to trust can be tricky. You might think of Uncle Dennis when you consider Kawhi Leonard. But not everyone is shady. The NBA suggests that roughly 30 to 40% of lottery picks have a manager overseeing them. Still, what happens after that can really shift things—Omar, for instance, ends up in the same league as Uncle Dennis. Maybe even in a worse spot, since Kawhi’s reputation could be damaged, but Omar’s situation might be even more complicated. It’s not like he had a huge bank account or anything. Omar might have drained Ace’s wallet by millions. The mock drafts had Ace going as high as pick three for Philly, but then, just a week before the draft, word got out that he hadn’t even done one workout with an NBA team. And that’s when Philly’s folks at three made a call. He’s canceling his workout and the scheduled meeting with them at the last second. People have been roasting Ace, calling him an entitled player who could potentially poison your franchise. But Omar stepped in and said, "Yo, 18 teams interviewed him. They all watched him work out at the NBA draft combine. He’s not what they’re making him out to be." The first player to turn down or cancel workouts, which really happened, was Alex Sar. A year earlier, he also refused to meet with the Hawks because he didn’t want to go there. So, what’s the big deal? The thing is, it’s pretty rare for a player to skip workouts for any team at all. His handler was basically insisting on which team he was going to play for. And that team? Well, Mark Stein just confirmed that Washington was the lottery pick. Several rivals mentioned that was Ace Bailey’s top choice for landing spot. The Wizards. Honestly, no offense, but it’s not exactly a dream situation. The Wizards aren’t exactly a well-oiled machine like Oklahoma City or San Antonio. They’ve been pretty directionless, with no real wins or success since the 1970s. On the flip side, Philly might have something special brewing. With a 6’8” forward like Ace teaming up with a promising young star point guard like Tyrese Maxi, they could be onto something pretty solid. So, why force it? Trouble brewing for DC? That’s when everything started to seem a little fishy, and the conspiracy theory really took off. Now picture yourself as a GM on draft night. You’re about to pick in the top five, ready to spend millions on this young talent, and out of nowhere, his representatives call you and say, Don’t bother drafting us. We’ll just skip out if you do. Honestly, you wouldn’t try that move unless you believe you're LeBron James. But you know what? The Jazz went ahead and picked him anyway. They grabbed Ace at number five because Danny A basically said, “I’m not gonna let Omar Cooper’s handler push me around.” I'm Danny A. At first, I was worried Ace might not show up, but he did come through. Turns out, he was completely professional the whole time. In fact, a local Utah paper described him as, “From every possible source, Bailey is a humble, hardworking hoops enthusiast with a heart of gold who…”. He's really excited to kick off his professional journey and keep expanding his skills. So, what’s the backstory? That’s when everyone first heard of Omar Cooper. He shared this odd video on social media, just staring into his camera. Definitely a bit strange for someone in his 40s. And if Ace... If Ace had dropped to just eight, it could have set him back over 10 million dollars. Fortunately, the Jazz ended up taking him, reducing the potential penalty from around 3 to 5 points, which would have been roughly 2 million. But the true price was his reputation. Because now, the first thing people think when they hear Ace is… Bailey is stuck in this really toxic mess. But honestly, Ace didn’t end things with Omar—surprisingly, he kept him around. It took something completely different just before this season that finally put an end to their relationship. On September 19th, the Wizards revealed they signed Sheree Cooper to a two-way NBA deal. That announcement caught a lot of people off guard, especially those who keep an eye on two-way contracts because… Sheree spent the past few years bouncing around Europe, playing for teams that weren’t even at the Euro League level. She hadn’t been in the NBA since 2022, so it’s pretty strange. And then, just five days later, on September 24th, Ace finally cuts ties with Omar Cooper and is now searching for someone new. Could Ace be convinced that Omar used him just to get his son back into the league? We’re not really sure, but the timing definitely raises some eyebrows. It kind of seems like Omar might have given Ace a word to push him toward the Wizards, maybe to avoid a trade—like he was orchestrating a little game behind the scenes. So, teams that are genuinely eager for a top-notch prospect usually have to give up some assets to move up in the draft. But if Omar managed to convince Ay to let things go, they could get the player without giving up much at all. Maybe in exchange, they promised to give his son a second shot at something. So, I’m not saying that’s what actually went down, but that’s the conspiracy floating around. It kind of seems like Ace might think that too, just from the timing alone. The simpler, more straightforward explanation is that Omar built connections with the Wizards throughout this process, using it as an opportunity to get something out of it. His son seemed like a genuine opportunity at first. Maybe. But the timing of his firing really raises some eyebrows. It kind of points towards the possibility that Ace might buy into the conspiracy more than the straightforward explanation. I mean, Ace stuck with Omar even when there was criticism, millions disappeared, and draft chaos was happening. That wasn’t enough to make him cut ties. He was about to fire Omar, but then Sheree signed with the Wizards, and just five days afterward, Ace ended his connection with Omar. That timing’s hard to overlook. Now, we’ll find out if Ace is really as talented and promising as everyone claims, both as a kid and a player. If he’s moving on, that’s probably for the best, and it’ll be interesting to see how he develops from here. It really hurts when a young family member gets exploited like this. It should serve as a warning for other kids and their families too. We talk all the time about Draft Bus, but honestly, sometimes it's not just about the player's talent. A lot of it comes down to who’s running the show. Ace Baileyy’s story could turn out to be about so much more than just basketball. It’s really about how quickly young talents can lose their footing before they even step onto an NBA court. Oh, and by the way, huge thanks to Cheese Guy8 for leaving a comment on an earlier video and giving me that tip. Getting into this story, it was a pretty solid idea all around. But one person who’s been steady as a clock is Victor Wimyama. Aside from the injuries, he’s been flawless. But then again, injuries do pop up. Turns out, he just went through another growth spurt, which probably isn’t the best news, but it’s something he’s gotta deal with. Did anything happen this summer that might actually help Wimi unlock his incredible potential?
