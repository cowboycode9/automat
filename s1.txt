Even more details have emerged about Giannis leaving the Bucks. So Ian Begley, the best New York reporter, says in August the Knicks made an offer, not a small one, but a real offer. Yet we have a good sense of what that was because Begley also mentions Jaylen Brunson That status left the Knicks untouchable. So likely they floated a Giannis-for-OG Anobi and Muel Bridges package with draft compensation, or a Giannis-for-Carl Anthony Towns deal plus Tyler Kick salary and the same draft sweetener. Yet the Knicks reportedly hung up and we’re still not sure what happened next anyway. discovering this now, two months on, right before the season opens. Why would anyone leak this now? Well, we know it wasn't the Bucks who released it because they don't want this out. I mean, just check their social media. They're trying extremely hard to act like it's nothing, really. Nothing's happening. They're like that house on fire. This is fine meme posting, like, "Oh, Giannis says he loves Milwaukee, everybody." Like, shut up. Stop being so defensive about it. You're making it worse for everyone. It's like that Kings player Devin Carter last night who's pretending like, "Oh, if" I'll grow my hair out so long it covers this hairline. Friend, we all know what's happening. Face the truth. Giannis is the Bucks' current bad hairline. And I'm not saying they should cut him or trade him, but just don't pretend otherwise. We all know where this is headed. Yet the Knicks weren’t the leak either. They don’t want a star like Carl Anthony Towns to think you tried to trade him right before the season. So that leaves one leaker. Only about two weeks until the NBA starts this season. Until then, Prize Picks is the best place to win cash while watching sports. Like last week, our pick just so happened to hit, which is great. And we're going to try again this week.

You assemble a lineup by tweaking a few players’ stats, deciding whether to push or pull on specific numbers. The idea is simple: adjust toward more or toward less in key areas. For example, this week I’m targeting the first big WNBA game, and we’re going less. That feels like part game plan, part quick decision, and the flow keeps you engaged without feeling overwhelmed. If you want, I can walk you through it anytime soon. Regarding Chelsea Gray's assists. And naturally, NFL Sunday brings Derrick Henry into spotlight, plus more on his fantasy score.

That is, play your first five, get 50 bucks in free lineups instantly, win or lose, code AM hoops. Just listen to what Sham said the other day. You look around the league and he plans to carry on, I'm told, keeping his options open. and his agent Alex Roatz of Octagon. He's been fielding huge interest in Giannis since the May draft combine. He'll sit at the center of handling and guiding this situation. What? How does he know that? it seems, Because Giannis's agent leaked this to Shams. It's where he gets a lot of his information from agents. And that agent wants to put pressure on the Bucks and to put everyone else on notice. Hey, my guy is about to leave, so get the packages ready. And oh, Giannis wants to be the good guy here. He wants his agent out there leaking the news, doing his bidding while he says, "I'm a committed buck in front of cameras." We all know what's really going on. Giannis leaked this through his agent to put the Bucks in the league on notice. Oh, but Giannis would never do that. He's a good guy. No, Giannis's agent isn't gonna go out and do that without his blessing. Dude would get fired the next day. So Giannis was asked about this and he told the Milwaukee media, "I've said this many times. I want to be in a situation that helps me win and I believe in this team. The moment I step on this court, I am locked into whatever I have in front of me. Now if in six or seven months I change my mind, that's pretty human, too." What? You're making it worse, Giannis. It's like, say you're committed. Don't add, "Oh, and I might change my mind." That kills everything else you just said before. So, if you don't think that Giannis is behind these sudden leaks, I don't know what to tell you. But why is he leaking this now right before this season? Well, you have to remember Giannis has done this not once or twice, but three times before. Back in 2020, Bucks shocking collapse in the bubble. So, Giannis made it clear that if they aren't contending, he ain't playing for him. So, the Bucks then traded a massive hall for Drew Holiday before the 2021 season. Then few weeks later, Giannis signs his Supermax extension to stay. Like, yeah, you're all in, I'm all in. Then in 2023 again says, I won't sign unless we're contenders. So, they go all in for Damen Lillard. Again, Giannis stretches forward. In 2024, following an early playoff exit, Giannis states, "I don't want to be 40 and regret not having one more." So they fire Adrien Griffin midseason. A desperate move to keep your superstar happy. So this isn't new, right? Giannis does this habitually too. When he feels things are going south, he applies the pressure. And that's not unique. For example, Kobe Bryant was not going to be a lifetime Laker. He was so angry after Shaq left for Miami. This dude demanded a trade on camera. Said he would never wear a Laker jersey again. How is that for harsh? But then the Lakers traded for Pal Gasol, which won them back-to-back titles. Kobe retires a Laker. Even Tim Duncan almost left the Spurs. The Orlando Magic recruited him and they both thought it was a good fit, but at the last minute Tim pledges again to stay with San Antonio. The Spurs would go on to claim five titles. And here's part of that tale: Duncan supposedly asks then Magic coach Doc Rivers if his wife could ride on the team plane, and Rivers says no. So Tim replies, "Uh, never mind." "I'm sticking with Coach Pop." But what's different with Giannis is that whenever he flexes his leverage, the Bucks respond, and that tactic paid off only once, with Drew Holiday. It's like Kobe getting his pal Gasol, yet he still exited in the first round every season. Kobe would have left. So it makes me mad that a guy like Charles Barkerley says this about the Greek freak. It's interesting how these guys, they feel like they're entitled to play for the championship every year. It's unfortunate he feel like he's entitled to win the championship every year. Everybody wants to win a championship. What's he talking about? First of all, Chuck asked out of Philly to try to win in Phoenix. Then the guy rolls into my hometown Houston to team up with Scotty Pippen trying to chase a ring. Now all of a sudden, Giannis isn't allowed to By the way, Giannis still hasn’t gone beyond the second round since his 2021 title. He’s endured three consecutive first-round exits while regarded as the world’s second-best player the entire time. Much of that came from injuries, but he isn’t owed anything here, he just wants to play. meaningful basketball as an all-world player. Is that too much to ask? So, once again, Giannis is applying the pressure like he always has. But unless a miracle happens this time, what would a trade actually look like? Well, there are only two ways that this can go because the Milwaukee cannot control any of their first round selections through 2031. So, in a trade, they either seek a player package to stay viable or want their selections returned to enable a rebuild. That's the gist. So, the Knicks might actually be viable if the Bucks want to trade today Stay in the race. But unfortunately they already nixed a deal without Jaylen Brunson. So unless that changes, they're done. Plus, the East is weak. If the Knicks reach the finals, there's no way they blow this thing up. So, who actually owns the Bucks picks that they truly need. Want to bounce back? Well, the Hawks are in control in 2026, but let's skip that detail. So, indeed Giannis is on the squad. Then comes the Pels and mostly the Blazers. What a period to cheer for Portland. They’ll cash in when this shakes out, like when the Rockets Targeting a three-team deal, Portland would respond, 'Sure thing. We'll return the picks for Reed Shepard and those Suns picks you own.' Or if the Warriors want Giannis, Portland would reply, 'Yep, no problem,' for Jonathan Gaminga and Brandon Pazipski. And yeah, I know that’s a lot to manage expectations. The Blazers may set the terms, but they hold all the cards here. If any team truly wants Giannis that badly, they’ll have to pay up. Milwaukee wants its own picks back. They need them back. Portland has the leverage, but so does Giannis, I guess. Yeah, I suppose so. could ink that 4-year $275 million extension next year, just like he’s done before. But Giannis might finally say this time, hey, I’m on the wrong side of 30. And if I’m truly going to win again, I’ve got to leave. So he’s just getting us all ready for it So, what about the Spurs? Giannis and Victor Wembanyama. Wembanyama has looked impressive this preseason on the floor. Yet the off-season physical transformation he underwent is what has people in the NBA buzzing. It's rattling scouts and changing the NBA narrative.
