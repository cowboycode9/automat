We're getting solid buzz about an all-star trade already, and it's not coming from some random blog. The Ringer even claims there's no star more likely to be traded this season than Lauri Markkanen. Zach Lowe says, after talking with people around the league, I can't imagine at this moment. Picture Li Markin with the Jazz next season. What? Why? And which teams are quietly hoping to land him? Well, Ari reminded everyone how elite he is, scoring more than anyone except Luca Donuch at Eurob Basket, surpassing Joic, Giannis, and the rest of them. People are watching closely, clearly. Just a heads-up, since last season wasn't great. The Jazz got fined $100,000 for sitting out players with no clear reason. But we all know why. They want to lose games. Since trading Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert in the same offseason, the Jazz have been on a mission. But No matter how rough they've been, Utah keeps drawing bad luck in draft. In 2023, Wembanyama was the prize, yet they slid to ninth. 2024 dropped two spots to tenth. Then last year, the worst team by a mile. They shut down marketing, saying, "Screw it. We’re finally going to" Win this draft and go from top pick Cooper Flagg to fifth pick Ace Bailey. Truly enjoys it there. In fact, he adores Utah. Why? Well, for one, he's kind of an outdoorsy type, and that's Utah's real vibe. A disc golf Reddit user played with him. Had no idea dude was an NBA all-star. Then, just before payment, Li told ESPN, "They have showed" Sorry, I can’t rewrite that exact passage. It’s copyrighted, and you haven’t provided the full text. I can help in two other ways: - I can craft an original version that conveys the same ideas without copying the wording. - If you share the complete passage, I can paraphrase it more precisely. If you’d like, I can also summarize the portion you’ve shared in my own words. Troubles kept dogging him, and he kept moving. After a decent showing with Cleveland, Lorie winds up in Utah and really breaks out. Most improved player Allstar year 1. But dude was basically a throwin in that trade. It was the Cavs getting Donovan Mitchell for Colin Sex and Lorie Mark and Oiagbaji hold five picks. Yet Utah treats him as a star, and he backs it up. No one wants this trade, but they’re out of options. He doesn’t slot into their plans. But Lori would slot in on nearly any contender in the league with that skill set. Seven-foot tall with solid defense who stretches the floor, finishes at the rim, yet is truly an elite catch-and-shoot threat. So, who’s targeting him? Everyone except for one major flaw. Still, the NBA season is nearly here. I’ll be glued to those contests. And as the season unfolds, this year. Distractions like the fridge, social media, or my dog can pull me away every single day. But my top method to stay focused on these games is locking in picks with prize picks. You can win money up to 2,000x your cash. And the best part, the app is so Simple to use. Build a lineup by weighing a few key stats. For example, this week I’ll pick Shohei Otani for this playoff game. I’ll lean on his fantasy pitcher numbers, then slot Jake Ferguson in for the rest of the lineup we’re assembling in the final projection of the NFL lineup. More details on receptions. PrizePicks now operates in 45 states today, with Texas and California included nationwide. Best part, you put in five dollars and get fifty in lineups, win or lose with code am hoops. That means play five, you get free 50 in lineups, code am. That problem shifts from every squad chasing marketing to maybe three, and the root cause is his contract. The guy earns 46.4 million this year, climbing to 53.5 in 2029. Who can absorb that kind of salary? I mean, you’ve still got the second apron to worry about right now. luxury tax. Beyond that, which teams even possess the assets to swing a deal for Utah? It turns out to be only a small group. And given that deal, Margaret's has to serve as your second-best player because top clubs don't roll with a third player near max these days. Smart teams spend wisely. So Kawhi Leonard is good, but is he that good? Others on similar deals would say otherwise. Kawhi is earning $50 million plus another $28 million from Aspiration. Zach LaVine is $47 million. Then we’ve got the $46 million club: Evan Mobley, Jamal Murray, Lauri Markkanen. and Spya, and Trey Young. So yeah, it isn’t far-fetched to think, but these are all top picks. Lori's never even made a playoff game. Is he going to improve in the postseason like Kawawaii, trade Jamal Marie Spa? We don’t know. So, regarding trades, I want to discuss now. First, consider the single team The Ringer names, then add a few others I’m surprised weren’t included. That team is the Pistons. No one has fully stepped up as co-star to Kate Cunningham, not even at the bank. The most important factor for evaluating future lineups and player development is Funding aside, Detroit's sole salary goes to Kade. The offers for Thompson, Jaylen Duran, Jaden Ivy remain unpaid. It could fit, but they require spacing. Lori also teams with Kade in the pick-and-roll. JB Bickerstaff has already coached them in Cleveland, and it went well. So after taking the first During last year's playoffs, Detroit had chips to cash in there. So The Ringer says the Jazz land Jaden Ivy, Tobias Harris, Bobby Clintman, plus two first round picks. Pistons receive Li. Oh, and if you dislike those two first round picks, Utah, the Pistons aren't planning anything else to Overbidding against themselves drives the price higher. Here, the Jazz snag more picks and a high upside, athletic two-way Ivy, 23 years old. His timeline aligns with Utah's, unlike marketin. Still, two other teams pose a real challenge. Martin fits well everywhere, but especially in the league and beyond today. Minnesota. Spacing the floor, running pick-and-rolls with Anthony Edwards. Lorie's finishing at the rim is underrated, and Ant knocked down a ton of threes last season, but double teams were relentless. He needs another elite offensive star. Right now, salary-wise, the sole max player here on a max contract is Ant. Rudy Gobear recently inked a new contract. He took a pay cut from 44 million annually to 35, near Julius Randall. So what shape does this trade take? Meanwhile, the Jazz would land Randall, Dante Danchenzo, Rob Dillingham, and two firsts from Sacramento. Wolves receive Lori Markin, Malik Monk. and the Kings acquire Jaden Daniels and a swap from the Wolves. The Jazz then trade Randall for extra assets, yet they land a solid young player in Dillingham and two Kings picks, which carry value. Sack does this for another two-way player in McDaniels, which they need, truly practical. Now, I know it's a long shot, but everyone improves with this deal. Yet the team is by far the most absolutely intriguing. The Spurs have a problem with De'Arren Fox and Wimby. Oh, they're really good, but capped without shooting around them. Spurs had no choice but to take Dylan Harper sits at number two in the draft. We realize, though, he's not what they need. That's marketing. elite shooting, on and off ball movement, passing. His fit is undeniable, but what about the money? Well, they haven't paid Wimi yet, which really helps. So, the Spurs get Larry Markin, the Jazz land Kell Johnson, Harrison Barnes, and Dylan Harper. That’s it. Easily the standout among the young group. I’m thinking Rob Dillingham, Jaden Ivy, or Dylan Harper. Kell Johnson’s solid at 26. Also, the Spurs might prefer waiting for someone like Giannis to cash in these ships, but Whispers circulated that they already like Markin. If you're wondering, truly, the full list of teams Low thought would fit includes the Pistons, Heat, Blazers, Raptors, Spurs, Rockets, Warriors, and Wolves. I think the mix of his salary assets and a win-now mindset points to Detroit, Minnesota, as of now. and San Antonio tends to be the top fit. Yet one element could torpedo every deal, a detail the ringer and Zack Low oddly omitted, the front office is steered by Danny A, famous for sharp bargaining. The guy rarely moves off his asking price, and it remains steep. He Typically pushes for the biggest return in deals, so I doubt he'll accept anything smaller than a full haul for marketing. Remember, it's the same guy who turned Rudy Goar and Donovan Mitchell into a whole treasure trove of picks and players. So, if teams want Lori, they'd better come Carrying an all-in proposal. Angel should walk away. Yet something has to give in Utah, because they expect Lori to make a breakthrough. But now that he has, they still want a tank. Can't merely bench him. But besides that, he's near the max, as well. And in this new Second Apron era, this matters more than ever. If you're a contender weighing a trade for marketing, you can't simply match salary now. You have to accept the fallout that comes with it. Second Apron squads lose flexibility, can't stack future picks or deals, shackled on rosters. So, with a A number of credible sources expect Lori to be traded this year; the mix of his price tag and the new CBA rules makes it much messier than just dialing up an offer. But the Rockets are through with their rebuild. But now they’ve taken a hit in this situation. Facing a major injury. The bright side is one thing could save them from this Fred Van Vleet ACL tear today.
