So, what’s the deal with Bull Bo? Apparently, he was just messing around with Kevin Durant, and now he’s out of a job. Crazy, right? But get this, he still calls Phoenix home. No NBA gigs anymore—just hitting up parties every night. How do I know? Well, I heard it from this guy on Reddit whose coworker lives two doors down from him. Yeah, I know, the details might not be rock-solid, but that's the story we’ve got. Just so you know, he's not currently on an NBA roster. So, what’s the story? You might assume he’s not good enough, but that’s really not the case. For instance, between February 7th and the end of last year, Bull put up some solid numbers—averaging 13 points and five rebounds per game, shooting 54% from the field and 38% from three. And he’s 7’2”. That includes several games where he scored over 20 points. So, what’s the story there? Turns out, there’s more to it than most realize, and Bowl is just one of five talented players who don’t have an NBA team lined up at the start of the season. You could go straight to the part about Bowl if you want, but I… Trust me, these five picks are totally worth your attention. But have we been on a roll with prize picks lately? Absolutely. Still, it’s not just about the money for me. I hop into prize picks to stay engaged, especially since I'm counting down the days until NBA season kicks back off, which is almost here. But… What I love most about Prize Picks is how simple their app is to navigate. Building a lineup just means choosing whether you think a player’s stats will be higher or lower. Easy peasy. So, let’s aim to get all three right. This week, I’m sticking with NFL Sunday action. First up, let’s see how it goes. Hey, I’m Isaiah Pacheco—I'm focusing more on his rushing and receiving yards rather than Drake May’s passing touchdowns. If you only agree with one of my picks, I totally get it, even though I’ve hit all four so far. But for this week’s biggest value, it’s Steph Curry. Yep, you heard that right. This is the first NBA discount of the year. All you need to do is pick one of my suggestions plus Steph. Price Picks is now available in 45 states, including Texas, where I’m at, and California. And if you put in just five bucks, you’ll get $50 worth of lineups right away. Win or lose, use the code. AM hoops. That’s play five, and you get 50 bucks right away—no strings attached. Win or lose, just use the code AM hoops. Starting with Malik Beasley, who had one of the top three-point seasons in NBA history last year—actually eighth best all time. But this summer, the FBI dropped news that they’re looking into him for a ongoing investigation. There was a gambling crime that led to a three-year, $42 million extension with Detroit getting canceled. Then, his agent suddenly says, "Oh, never mind. No charges have been filed." But now, the NBA is looking into it, and it’s pretty clear he was involved. A different investigation by Pablo Tori, along with Tom Havstro, obviously shows Jonte Porter's gambling history. Ring was collaborating with Beasley. The big breakthrough was a tweet from someone connected to Jonte Porter, claiming that first was Jonte, then Rosier, and that soon we’d hear about MB. A few months later, the news about Malik Beasley finally dropped. How did that person know? Was it just a coincidence? Alright, I won’t go as far as saying he definitely broke the rules, but you can understand why no NBA team is eager to jump in on him just yet, even after that incredible season last year. Moving on to Victor Oladipo. Vic was an all-star, and he's now part of a recent string of disappointing moments in his career. Here's a fresh take on that idea: NBA trend. It’s like those former stars who hit hard times with injuries and just can’t shake the desire for a comeback. Think Isaiah Thomas or Demarcus Cousins—guys who showed so much promise but then faced setbacks. Oladipo fits right into this pattern. He was an All-Star and made the All-Defense team, but in 2019 he tore his quad tendon and never quite recovered the same explosiveness. After a long string of false starts and frustrating setbacks, it seems like he’s finally making some progress now. In China, his Chinese team faced off against the Spurs and Clippers during this preseason. Vic really shined, pulling out some stepbacks and maneuvering around the other Victor like it was nothing. You know, just win byama for a bucket. Debo also put up some serious numbers—42 points over two games, along with eight assists and seven steals. So, what's the issue? Well, as of now, no team has quite figured out how to contain him. I reached out, but there might be a silver lining. Malcolm Brogden unexpectedly retired as a backup for the New York Knicks, which opens up a spot. That means the Knicks or maybe another team could be reaching out to Oladipo pretty soon. We’ll just have to wait and see if he can actually make it in the NBA this time, unlike those other veterans we talked about earlier. So, about the Knicks and Ben Simmons—they offered him a minimum deal, and he turned it down. Why? Because he expects more, something that matches his all-star label. Like he's still in 2020 or something. But after refusing that dunk attempt in Game 7, Ben's stock took a pretty steep drop. Sixers because Ben was so hesitant about taking shots, he was even afraid to shoot free throws. He’d go out of his way to avoid getting fouled just to steer clear of the pressure. People focused a lot on his mental health, but there’s more to it. Since leaving Philly, Simmons has undergone two back surgeries, and you can tell there’s quite a bit more beneath the surface. Just look at his performance out there. It’s obvious he’s not that MVP or all-star caliber player anymore. If he doesn’t acknowledge that and accept a smaller role, his career could be finished by the time he’s only 29. Moving on, though—next up is Markelle Fultz. Can you believe how wild it is that Philly had— There were two top picks that totally fizzled out before they even hit 30. But Foltz? He’s actually been pretty solid recently. Just two years back, he tore his ACL in Orlando, and yet in 2023 he started 60 games, averaging 14 points and six assists on 51% shooting. How is that not an impressive comeback? Is he still an NBA player? Last year, he was with Sacramento. Even though they desperately needed a point guard, the team decided not to bring Foltz back, choosing instead to go with Russell Westbrook. It turned out he was pretty underwhelming in Sacramento, and Markelle eventually dropped out of the rotation. The new coach didn’t seem to trust him much. Doug Christie chose Demar D Rozan to fill in behind Zack Lavine, even though it’s not really his usual spot. Over 21 games, Foltz only managed about three points, one rebound, and one assist per game. Honestly, he’s a solid player, but maybe just not quite at NBA caliber. That said, he still has the potential to... Heading abroad for a lengthy career at 27 sounds impressive, but being the number one overall pick in 2017? Honestly, a bit overhyped. That brings us to Bull Bull. There was one thing that really derailed him in Phoenix. After that, it’s possible we might never see him playing in an NBA game again. But you never know, right? You know how Shaq keeps comparing Bull to Victor Wimyama? What he's really getting at is that Bull was actually doing this first. We've never seen anyone like Wimi, but honestly, even before Wimi made his mark, Bull was already showcasing that kind of talent back in the bubble. The guy’s 7 foot 2, but moves so smoothly like a guard. He’s blocking shots, hitting big shots — he’s got that rare combination of size and skill that’s hard to come by. So it turns out Wimby is a full five inches taller than Bowl, but honestly, watching them play is still a blast. Wimby’s got a pretty unique skill set. The only real issue has been consistency, and that connects back to the draft. You see, Bowl had a foot injury back in college, which caused him to fall from being a top prospect to where he is now. He was a lottery pick all the way up to the second round, which makes benching second-round players a lot simpler. Plus, he was behind Nicole Yic on a team that's all about winning now, so riding the bench was his reality. When Bowl moved to Orlando, though, it was like hitting reset. He ended up starting 33 games and averaged around... In December, 10 and Six shot 40% from beyond the arc, but it seemed like the same issue always held him back. Coach Michael Malone mentioned, "I believe there's been a steady message to Bull that no one ever doubts his talent or skills, but what has sometimes been questionable..." Maybe it’s your work ethic, your dedication, or your discipline—that’s a red flag. In Orlando, the coaches were getting pretty frustrated because Bull would often zone out during games, especially on defense. He was given one last shot in Phoenix, and don’t forget, when Bull started to get hot, everyone tried to feed him Wary. But then… On March 12th during the game against Houston, everything suddenly exploded. Steven Adams and Mason Plumbley ended up in a confrontation, and Mason got knocked to the floor. Seriously, what could be more intense than two seven-footers throwing punches? The teammates all rush in to back up their guy, except Bao. Just look at him. He’s so uninterested, so bored, he basically just starts like… Shooting layups, which honestly is kind of hilarious to watch, but you know who didn’t find it funny? Coach Mike Buddenhoer. He was so pissed off. The guy benched Bull for the entire rest of the season, and honestly, we might never see him back on the court. It probably was just the final straw for him. Bull’s just chilling behind the scenes, as usual—that’s pretty much his style. So, what’s he up to now? It turns out his real passion is fashion. He’s needed custom clothes for most of his life, and now he’s completely hooked. The guy even started a resale page where he would flip pieces and make moves in that scene. He splurged on luxury items like a pair of jeans worth $18,000, all while raking in millions. Clearly, he just truly enjoys indulging. Honestly, it’s wild to think about if he put that same level of focus into his basketball career. As for Bull Bull, what’s the story there? Well, Kid managed to earn around $10.5 million from his once-in-a-billion chance. With genetics on his side, he's now able to zero in on what really matters to him. Honestly, I can respect that approach. There are also a few honorable mentions that didn't quite make the cut. Alec Burke, for example, managed to shoot 40% from three — four of his last five seasons— even when he wasn’t part of any team. Then there's Keon Ellis, who... Last year, he was the Nets’ top player in minutes. Cory Joseph may still have some gas in the tank. Tory Craig is mainly there for his defense. But one guy who clearly has a passion for basketball is Bronny James. The only thing is, his preseason has been so rough that you start wondering if he’s really an NBA player at this point. Unfortunately for Bronny, it looks like these could be his last days in the league, and there's some evidence to back that up.
