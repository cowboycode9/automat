Back in 1992, the Olympics decided to let NBA players compete in the basketball tournament. Big misstep. Since then, Team USA has taken home seven out of eight gold medals, with an incredible 58 and 4 record—meaning they win about 94% of the time. The Americans weren’t just hard to beat; they were almost unbeatable, period. Until now, that is. The USA might be heading for some serious trouble. In 2024, they were really struggling and almost didn't make it, but Steph Curry and LeBron James stepped up and saved the day. The problem is, that kind of heroism might not be there next time because Team USA is aging, and there aren't clear young stars waiting in the wings. On the other side, the rest of the world is closing the gap fast, and France could have a real shot at overtaking them. Right now, the best player in the world and Victor Wembanyama stepping into his prime. So, who’s likely to make the upcoming US Olympic basketball team? It’s going to look pretty different without names like LeBron, Stefan, or KD around. But honestly, the rest of the world has been closing the gap for quite some time now. We’re aware that MVPs aren’t exclusively American these days. The last one was James Harden back in 2018, and he also took home Defensive Player of the Year that year. Rudy Gobert has been in the mix almost every season, and Wenyen Gabriel is up next. But it’s not just the seasoned veterans making waves. The new generation of players is stepping into the spotlight too. These are the non-American first-round NBA draft picks making their mark. In just the past few years, we've seen a lot of talent emerge, and most of these guys are lottery picks—top-tier players, the very best. But for the Americans, the real obstacle boils down to one small six-letter word: France. You see all these young guys sneaking up around Victor Wanyama, but that’s been the main issue—that France puzzle. For other countries in the past, it’s always been a challenge. Sure, a nation might have one or two real NBA stars, but they can't match up against a full-strength USA team packed with top-tier talent. So far, that’s mostly held true—that 2004 bronze was pretty much the only exception. But cracks are starting to show. In 2016, the US team faced some close calls, revealing that the gap might not be as wide as it used to be. The team had some notable victories in group play, including three-point wins over France and Serbia. However, in 2021, their 25-game win streak came to an end. France took the top spot in Group A, and in Paris, things almost went sideways. The US was down by 13 points in the fourth quarter against Serbia, and it was only Steph Curry going into "clutch mode" that turned things around, hitting crucial shots to pull the game out. Nine threes. He pulled off another one late in the game against France, sealing the deal and grabbing gold. But here’s the thing. Curry won’t be around forever, and neither will LeBron, KD, or any of those guys who came through for TM USA in Paris. By 2028, they’ll all be past their prime or hanging up their sneakers. Check out how old the biggest stars in the US will be for the next Olympics. In 2028, LeBron is going to be 43, Steph will be 40, KD will be 39, Drew Holiday 38, and even Anthony Davis will be 35. So, what we saw in Paris wasn’t just an Olympic team — it was a collection of vets who’ve been around for a while. Olympic retirement tour. So, who’s the next in line? It’s a question that’s been swirling around, especially in NBA circles. Everyone’s wondering who will carry the torch as the next big American star. But just like with the Olympic team, there’s no obvious answer in sight, making it pretty tricky to pin down. Instead of just throwing out names, how about we piece together this team one player at a time? This piece dives into what really decides victory in international basketball: shot creation, defense, shooting, leadership, and size. We’re going to look at who’s a clear favorite and who’s a dark horse in each of these areas. Because one bad pick could mean the difference between gold, silver, or even missing the podium altogether. First up is the alpha scorer. You know, the guy who’s the go-to, the one who can take over a game whenever it’s needed. The LeBron-Steph type player is capable of scoring from anywhere on the court. Whether it's late in the shot clock, under heavy pressure, double teamed, or in any tough situation, they find a way to get a bucket. I see two clear-cut locks and two dark horse contenders. The first lock is Anthony Edwards. He'll be 27 during the next Olympics in LA and has already shown he can fit right in with the best. With the Olympics in Paris, he's stepping into his first Games as an alpha, and he's already working on broadening his game to include a three-point shot. He's heading into what should be his prime around 2028. Then there's Jason Tatum, who's 30 and gearing up for his third Olympics. Last year, he suffered from some tough times with his role on the team, feeling the heat for it. With two DMPs under his belt, Tat has been a real team player for USA Basketball, which really matters to them. Considering his age, I think they’re likely to position him as the top guy, but let’s be honest, everyone will know it’s Ant. My first underdog pick for American Alpha is Cade. Cunningham, he's 26 now and really starting to show what he's capable of in the NBA. If he keeps progressing like this over the next three years, he's going to be a force to reckon with. And before we move on to the final sleeper pick, there’s Paulo Beno, who’s 25. He’s already become the primary face of his NBA team, dropping 26 points and pulling down eight rebounds. Boards, five dimes a game, and just leveling up overall. Plus, he gave Italy the boot to play for the USA, so they’re probably going to want to show some appreciation for that. Now, our next type of player is that top-tier second option—the one who steps up when the alpha isn’t having his best game. Every NBA squad needs someone like that. Number two, and so does Team USA. We've got two solid guarantees, with two dark horses lurking as well. Lock number one is Devin Booker, who’s 31 years old. This will be his third Olympics, and he’s already proven he’s willing to do the gritty work and prioritize what’s best for the team. Our next certainty is Anthony Davis, who’s 35. He’s... Number two, and depending on how he's doing health-wise, he might also step into that elder statesman role. He’s been a vital part of USA Basketball for roughly 15 years now. But our first dark horse pick is Donovan Mitchell, who’s 31. It’s pretty wild to think he’s never actually made it at this point. Here’s a fresh take on that: Imagine an Olympic lineup. Team USA’s got a big gap to fill up top – no LeBron, Steph, KD. Spida’s the one stepping up big time. The last dark horse, which is practically a sure thing, is Jaylen Williams, aka JDub, age 27. He’s already shown he can be the No. 2 on a championship-winning NBA squad, and he’s solid on both ends of the court. Beast. Honestly, all these Oklahoma City guys could be the best in the world by 2028. Next up, let’s talk about the floor general. That’s the player who sets the pace, spreads out the floor, and can stay calm under the pressure of international defenses. It’s not just about putting up points; it’s about directing the game. A real lock to fill that role is Tyrese Haliburton. At just 28, he's already stepped onto the Olympic stage in Paris. And by the time he was 25, he had already played in an NBA Finals. Now, there's a strong possibility he's going to be the starting point guard for Team USA in LA. Our dark horse candidate is Jaylen Brunson, who's 31 and was one of the final cuts for the team. Paris games. His leadership could be invaluable. Our next player type is the defensive stopper. Think like Drew Holiday in the last Olympics. The guy who guards the other team's best player and makes his life hell. The lock is a men Thompson, age 25. Already one of the best defenders in the world and a top 1% athlete. Unless something terrible happens between now and 2028, his growth as a player makes him the luck. And the dark horse is Jaden Ivy, age 26, as long as his defense keeps trending up. But next is the big. You need that especially internationally. And it's probably the thinnest group for USA. Bam. Adabio, age 31. It's his third Olympics. He's a defensive killer and a rare veteran presence. But Chad Hongren, age 26, is the other lock. I mean, dude already beat Wimby with Team USA at the 20219 World Cup, and he was named tournament MVP. But our final player type is the young guy. Team USA has a tradition of bringing a young player who they think's going to be part of Team USA in the future, even if he doesn't play a ton. And the one lock That’s Cooper Flag. He’ll only be 21 in 2028. The guy’s already making a splash by practicing with the A team back before Paris at just 17. Everyone’s got him pegged as the next top American player. But what’s wild about this team is none of these players are expected to be the same kind of standout. The best guy in the world three years from now might be on a different team, maybe France. But Team USA has always had someone who could be considered the top player in the world. That’s no longer the case. So, it’s more crucial than ever to put together a squad that can compete at that level. Having a team packed with talent and chemistry by 2028 might turn into a disaster. But Kevin Durant, who’s still holding onto the idea of the next Olympics, might be the wild card. We all know he's eyeing that final big contract in the NBA, but Houston's not making it easy for him. The Rockets are playing tough, refusing to give in easily. It looks like the news got out that they’re not planning to give KD the max deal he’s after. Now, there's chatter that some problems could be brewing for his new team even before the season starts.
