Last night, a Mavs fan dressed in a Luca Lakers jersey sat beside new owner Patrick Dumont. The young guy admitted he had flipped Dumont off a few months back after he traded his favorite player, so he wanted to say sorry. Then, the 18-year-old shared what Dumont told him in response. He said he I was just trying to do what’s best for the organization, you know? Sometimes even with good intentions, you end up making mistakes. Right then, the owner was telling a fan it was a mistake to trust his own GM. So, honestly, it was only a matter of time before Nico Harrison’s departure happened. Fired. How long was the process? 14 hours and 30 minutes. First thing, fans of Mass have that kid to thank. But a new general manager? That's going to shake things up big time. The obvious move now is to trade Anthony Davis. Possibly, Kyrie Irving could be part of a rebuild centered around Cooper Flag. Especially since Dallas hit the jackpot with the number one pick. Choosing that was the obvious move. But Nico, he was the one person who would never go for it. Now he’s out of the picture, though. That means things in Dallas are about to shift quite a bit, and we’ll get into all of that soon. But honestly, I’m really pumped that Mint Mobile is sponsoring today’s session.

Big thanks to Mint Mobile for sponsoring this. Though, you’ve got to admit, it’s pretty good deal. So, there's this guy, Patrick Dumont. He’s not really into basketball, but his mother-in-law, Miriam Adds, runs the team with Mark Cuban, and she put Patrick in charge. He handled it the way you’d probably want—by trusting the experts around him, since he doesn’t really know the ins and outs of the game himself. When Nico came and said, “Hey, we’re trading Luca,” it honestly sounded pretty wild. But what does Dumont really know about basketball? He once commented, "Sha was a prime example of a strong work ethic." Another time, he referred to the finals as the championship games, like they're some kind of international event. And a good owner understands this—trusts their GM to handle the basketball side of things. The worst owners, on the other hand, tend to involve themselves in every decision, meddling where they shouldn't. Venture Capital is running a due diligence on the Kings, while James Dolan is doing the same with the Knicks. To be honest, Nico did some smart trades, bringing in players like PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford to support Luka, which helped them reach the finals. But then, adding Anthony Davis to a team already built around Luka? That was a different story altogether. That was a total disaster. AD was the absolute worst choice they could have made. Never mind that he's six years older and tends to get injured a lot. Putting that trust in him turned out to be a huge mistake that blew up in their faces. Dumont suddenly became the most despised owner in the entire sports world. There's a clip out there where he's walking to his seat for… The first time after the trade, the crowd just erupts with boos. You can see him glance at his crew, asking, "Is that for me? Are they booing me?" The guy had zero clue. Owning a sports team is supposed to be fun, right? So what’s going on here? Before long, he couldn't even step onto the court without facing that hostility. The games turned into a total nightmare. The trade basically boiled down to sending Luca out in exchange for Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a first-round pick — the worst deal you could imagine. And why did it go so badly? Because Nico was so fixated on getting AD that he ended up sabotaging his own chances. According to a report, Nico actually spoke with… Lakers GM Rob Pelinka was told to stay hush-hush about things for weeks. When Pelinka wanted to have a conversation with Luca, Nico shot him down. Because of that silence, the Lakers didn't really get a clear sense of Luca’s willingness to stay in LA long-term. As a result, they felt they couldn’t fully commit to him, and the Mavericks, of course, were in a different position altogether. agreed. The Lakers then preserved their other first round pick and Austin Reeves. So Nico fleeced himself for no reason. Normally the team acquiring the player doesn't want a leak to prevent a bidding war. But in this case, the team trading the superstar didn't want a bidding war. That is so insane. It's hard to comprehend. I mean, if you have to trade a 25-year-old superstar in his prime, at least you maximize the return, unless you're Nico Harrison. And by the way, of course, they didn't have to trade Luca Donuch. He just took them to a finals a few months before. But people ask, "Oh, but didn't the trade make him focused? How do you know if Luca was still in Dallas, he wouldn't still be fat and out of shape?" Yeah, you're right. But you have to at least try at 25 years old. Look at how many chances Zion has gotten or John Morant. Luca was nowhere near the point where you have to give up. And for Anthony Davis, so of course AD was injured at the time of the trade. They rush him back to play and after three quarters gets injured again. Meanwhile, Luca still fat mind you leads the Lakers to a three seed in the stacked Western Conference. Then this off season, dude goes on every magazine looking skinny, telling everybody, "Watch out for revenge." Then right on Q, Luke is out here dropping 37 tonight while AD's injured again. I’d feel pretty disappointed that Nico’s vision never really had a shot to come true. But honestly, we saw this coming from the start. AD’s nickname is street clothes, which was always part of the plan. And then, right in the middle of everything, something totally unexpected happens. If you wrote this into a movie, people would probably say it’s too crazy to believe. They’d tell you, “Nah, leave that out. That’s impossible.” But with only a 1.8% chance, they actually hit the jackpot and win a once-in-a-generation Cooper Flag. I know some folks think the NBA orchestrated it all—conspiracy theories and all—that it’s straight out of a movie. And after getting that lucky break from the… The basketball gods barely give us a 1.8% shot, but Nico's got this moment where he looks directly into the camera and says to his own fans, “Hey, now you’re starting to see the vision.” Seriously, what was that guy thinking? It’s like telling everyone they’re wrong for being upset when we all know he just got lucky. He’s not really that good. Now fans aren't even giving Cooper a chance to be appreciated for his growth. All they focus on is their superstar shining in purple and gold. It doesn’t seem fair to either Cooper or Mad fans. That’s when trust issues started to surface with Dumont. There was a report earlier this week mentioning a disagreement about whether to bring AD back. After the recent injury, he’s hurt once more, and Nico Harrison was pressing hard to get him back on the court, even arguing with the doctors about it. Dumont just stepped in and said, “No way, we’re not rushing him just so you can have your Nico Harrison comeback moment.” Got it? We’re not about to jeopardize this team’s well-being over a quick return. Sorry, but once Patrick Dumont, who admits he has no clue about basketball, steps in, you know things are about to change. With a new GM in charge, big shifts are on the way. The Mavs don’t have control over their own pick until 2031, except for this year. So, the obvious is pretty clear. The plan is to intentionally have this season go badly so they can snag a high draft pick. The idea is to trade away AD, maybe bring in Kyrie and other veteran players, and then focus on building a team around Cooper. Here's why I think this needs to happen: currently, they're trying to push Cooper into a win-now situation with questionable teammates, but they don’t have the assets left to really develop a solid core around him. Looking ahead to the future with Cooper, it’s like sacrificing Coupe now and down the line. It’s almost like tossing out two generations’ worth of talent—Luca and Cooper—just to get rid of them. They just can’t afford to do that. Turns out, the 2026 draft class is loaded right at the top, especially with one and two overall picks. These young players... Darren Peterson and AJ Deona would be perfect for Cooper Flag. The Mavericks really should make an effort. I get that the lottery’s a total gamble, but they’re sitting close to the bottom of the Western Conference. It only took me four spins on Tankathon.com to see the Mavericks land the top spot. I know, I know. It's early, and honestly, it feels kind of crazy to check Tankathon right now. Still, the Mavericks really can't afford to stay stuck in the middle. They need to tank for better positioning. So, it’s time to consider trading Anthony Davis. I do plan to make a full video breaking down all the possible moves Dallas has, but AD’s situation is a bit complicated. He's still... It's great when that option is there, but it’s never a sure thing. They won’t get a superstar package unless AD gets healthy and then starts playing like a superstar to boost his worth. But that wouldn’t be ideal, because if he did that, I’d end up winning a lot of games for the Mavs, and they definitely don’t want that. So, I guess I’ll just accept it. If the value's low and you're wondering where the realistic landing spots are, Chicago definitely tops the list. AD is a native of Shytown, and he’s been teasing the idea of playing there for years. The Bulls seem eager too — they’ve got a solid look and ambition to improve even more. And don’t forget, they’ve got Kobe White to include in any trade package, which could sweeten the deal. Kobe would make a great guard to team up with Cooper Flag. Another option to consider is Miami—they’re always chasing star players. AD enjoys playing the power forward position, which pairs nicely with Bamadion Bayo. And yeah, there's plenty of time ahead to see how things shake out, but as of now, Dallas has what? They definitely earned it. I doubt they’ll ever really move past the Luca trade, but this feels like a solid beginning, and right now, the hot story in the NBA is about the Bucks. Ryan Rollins has really been emerging as a breakout player for Milwaukee. But did you know his career was nearly over before it even got going? Two years back, the Bucks took a shot on him and gave his NBA career a fresh start. He’d previously been cut from the Wizards following an arrest, but his journey to bounce back has been pretty incredible.
