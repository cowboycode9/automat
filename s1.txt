The Ace Bailey controversy was the biggest story of the draft, second only to the Mads Landing Cooper flag. This kid was supposed to be a down-to-earth, modest guy, but right before the draft, he was acting like a total diva—bringing a lot of arrogance and attitude. However, behind the scenes, it wasn't actually Ace Bailey who was the source of all that behavior. It looks like Omar Cooper, who was managing Ace Bailey, might have been secretly pulling the strings, possibly costing Ace millions and damaging his reputation in the process. But now it turns out that Ace actually fired Omar Cooper, and there could be a wild conspiracy behind it all that makes the whole scandal way darker and more twisted than anyone realized. So, Ace ended up meeting… Omar moved from Tennessee to Georgia so his son, Omar Jr., could attend Mckitan High School and play basketball there. But Mckitan isn’t just any regular high school; it’s a national powerhouse. In 2019, it was ranked number one in the country when Omar’s son, Sheree Cooper, was a student there. So Omar essentially steps into a role as a gatekeeper in that basketball world. That Georgia to NBA pathway is pretty well known. But unfortunately for Share, things took a turn for the worse after high school. My favorite way to stay in shape is just to do a bit of working out here and there. But I always pay close attention to what I eat. What I've realized for myself is that 90% of maintaining a good fitness level is really all about that. When it comes to diets, I honestly prioritize convenience, affordability, and, above everything else, really good flavor. My Fit Foods has been great for me—they’ve made sticking to my meal plan so much easier. I’ve had quite a few people reach out and tell me they’re also fans of their food. Basically, they offer ready-made meals that only take a moment to prepare. It only takes a few minutes, and there are so many options that I never find myself bored. Plus, supporting the channel by checking them out and using my code AMH25 for 25% off your first purchase really helps. They have locations all across Texas, so it’s super convenient. You could even just walk into a... You can find their stores in Portland and Denver right now, with more openings on the horizon. I’ve tried countless meal prep spots, but honestly, My Fit Foods blows all of them out of the water. It’s hands down the best I’ve ever experienced. Definitely give them a look. And don’t forget, the discount code is AMH25. He attends Auburn as a… He was a five-star recruit, but he couldn’t play in the first 12 games because the NCAA was looking into whether he received improper benefits by contacting an agent. Once he was cleared, he finally took the court for the last 12 games at Auburn, but his scoring was underwhelming—just 20 points total and shooting only 23% from three-point range. Not exactly the breakout they’d hoped for. So, every expert told him he needed to focus, improve his shot, and figure out how to really make an impact moving forward. She returns to school, trying to boost her draft prospects, but no such luck. Sheree enters the draft, slips all the way to the second round, and only plays a few games for Atlanta before being sent overseas to China. So, from being a five-star prospect to heading to the Far East, with his dad Omar managing things. But even with all that, Ace still relies on this guy to be his manager. So, what exactly does a manager do? A lot of folks say Omar is just his agent, but that’s not quite right. A manager is someone a player truly trusts to look out for his best interests and help steer his life choices, whether it’s school endorsements, media appearances, or other big decisions. Figuring out who to trust can be tricky. Like Uncle Dennis for Kawhi? He’s a solid example. But not everyone is shady. NBA teams estimate that about 30 to 40% of lottery picks have a manager guiding them. Still, what happens after that is what really puts Omar on the same level as Uncle Dennis. Maybe even worse, because at least Kawhi’s reputation might take a hit, but… It’s not like it was his personal account or anything. Omar might have actually set Ace back millions. Coming into the draft, there were mock drafts putting Ace as high as third pick to Philadelphia. But then, just a week before the draft, people start hearing rumors that Ace hadn’t even done one workout with an NBA team. And that’s when Philly at three gets a call. He’s canceling both his workout and his meeting with them at the last minute. People were really ripping Ace, calling him an entitled player who could mess up your franchise. But Omar stepped in and said, "Yo, 18 teams interviewed him. They all saw him work out at the NBA draft combine. He’s not…" The first player to back out or cancel workouts, and that’s a true fact. It was actually a year earlier when Alex Sar turned down a meeting with the Hawks because he didn’t want to join them. So, why make a fuss over it? The thing is, it’s pretty rare for a player to skip workouts for any team at all. It’s basically his handler making a strong push for which team he’s going to end up with. And the team in question? Well, Mark Stein just confirmed that Washington was the lottery team. Several sources and rivals agree that the Wizards were Ace Bailey’s top choice. Honestly, no offense, but that’s not exactly a dream scenario. The Wizards aren’t exactly a beacon of progress like OKC or the Spurs. They seem more like a team wandering without a clear direction, with barely any wins since the 70s. On the other hand, Philly has a 6’8” forward in Ace who could be a perfect fit alongside a rising star point guard like Tyrese Maxi, especially if they’re aiming for something meaningful. So, what’s the point of forcing the issue? Difficult for DC? That’s when everything started to seem suspicious and when this conspiracy theory really took hold. But picture yourself as a general manager on draft night. You’ve got a top five pick, ready to shell out millions to a young player, and then his team suddenly calls you saying, Don't bother drafting us. We won’t even bother showing up if you do. You only pull that move if you believe you’re LeBron James. But here’s the thing— the Jazz still picked him anyway. They took Ace with the fifth pick because Danny A. told Omar Cooper, "I won’t be bullied by your handler." I'm Danny A. At first, I was worried Ace might not report, but he ended up showing up after all. And honestly, he was completely professional the whole time. A local Utah paper even described him as "a humble, hardworking basketball enthusiast with a heart of gold," from every source they could find. Omar Cooper was really excited to kick off his professional journey and keep expanding his skills. So, how did everyone find out about him? It all started when he uploaded this strange video of himself—just staring into his camera, no context, kind of a odd move, especially for someone in their 40s. And if Ace… If it had fallen to eight, Ace's deal could have run him more than 10 million bucks. Luckily, the Jazz picked him up, dropping his price from possibly three to five million, which was roughly two million. But the real hit was to his reputation. Now, whenever folks hear the name Ace, that's what comes to mind first. Bailey is stuck in this really toxic situation, but surprisingly, Ace didn’t end up firing Omar. It wasn’t until right before this season that something else finally ended that relationship. On September 19th, the Wizards announced they were signing Sheree Cooper to a two-way NBA contract. That was a real shock to fans who keep an eye on two-way deals because... Sheree was hopping around Europe over the past few years, playing for teams that weren’t even in the EuroLeague. She hadn’t been in the NBA since 2022, so it’s kind of strange. Then, just five days later on September 24th, Ace finally cuts ties with Omar Cooper and shifts their search for a new player. Do you think Ace genuinely believes Omar only used him to get his son back into the league? I honestly have no clue, but the timing definitely feels off. It kind of seems like Omar could have promised to steer Ace toward the Wizards without any trades involved. Yeah, the whole situation smells a bit fishy. So, teams that are really after a top-tier prospect usually have to give up some assets to climb higher in the draft order. But if Omar manages to persuade Ay to let the team tank it down, they could snag him without giving up anything at all. Maybe in exchange, they promised to give his son a second shot at something important. League. I’m not claiming that’s what actually occurred—that’s just the conspiracy theory. But it does seem like Ace might think so, especially when you look at the timing. The more straightforward explanation, though, is that Omar built connections with the Wizards throughout all of this and saw an opportunity to leverage those relationships for his own benefit. His son being an organic opportunity, maybe. But the timing of this firing really makes you question things. It kind of suggests that Ace might be leaning more toward believing in a conspiracy rather than just accepting an innocent explanation. I mean, Ace kept collaborating with Omar despite all the criticism, millions lost, the draft chaos. That clearly wasn’t enough to make him step back. He was about to fire him, but then Sheree signs with the Wizards, and just five days later, Ace cuts ties with Omar. You can't really overlook that timing. It'll be interesting to see if Ace is as much of a stand-up kid as people say, and if he's got the skills to back it up. If he's heading out now, I think that’s probably for the best. And it’s… Yeah. It really blows when a young person in your family gets exploited like this. Apparently, it's a wake-up call for other kids and their families too. We spend so much time discussing Draft Bus, but honestly, it’s not just about the players’ skills. A lot of it comes down to who’s actually running things behind the scenes. Ace Baileyy’s journey could turn out to be about a lot more than just basketball. It highlights how quickly young talents can lose their footing before they even step onto the NBA court. And by the way, a big thanks to Cheese Guy8 for leaving a comment on an earlier video with a tip. Here's a fresh take on that story. It was a really smart move. But one guy who hasn’t missed a step yet is Victor Wimyama. Aside from a few injuries, the kid’s been flawless. And speaking of injuries, he recently went through another growth spurt, which probably isn’t the best news, but it’s something. Did anything happen this summer that might actually help Wimi finally unlock his crazy potential?
