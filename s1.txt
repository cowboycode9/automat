He stood tall at 6'10, but his game was that of a guard—lightning quick handles, court vision, and a shooting touch. His physique was more like a power forward’s, yet he carried himself with a swagger that set him apart, someone who could easily put up a huge scoring night on any opponent. Coming out of Kansas State, he posted impressive numbers, averaging 26 points and 12 rebounds during his freshman year. That level of dominance was exactly what propelled him to be selected as the second overall pick in the draft. Derrick Rose had an 8th draft behind him, but right after, there were early red flags about Michael Beasley. He attended six different high schools in just five years. He was even kicked out of his rookie NBA camp and was in rehab by his second year. Despite all that, no one could ignore Beasley’s raw talent. It was too obvious, and that talent kept him in the league for over ten years, making 50 He was rolling in million-dollar paychecks, but behind the scenes, things were falling apart. Not long after sharing laughs with LeBron on the bench, Michael Beasley disappeared from the league completely. When he finally made a comeback, the story he shared about living in his car for years was something nobody had heard before. So, now he's back in the spotlight, reshaping what retired basketball players can do to earn a living. But I’ve got to wonder, what pushed things to such a low point that Michael Beasley had to spend two years living in his car? And more importantly, how did he manage to climb out of that terrible place and get back to where he belongs, on top? In a way, it’s like he’s creating himself from scratch.

He spent a lot of time playing basketball with Kevin Durant. Honestly, they had almost the same potential when they were kids. KD was the second-best prospect in his high school class, while Beasley was ranked third. Both ended up going to college, and both actually won Big 12 Player of the Year during their college careers. After that, they both ended up as the second overall selection in the NBA draft. Beasley, though, carried some serious warning flags with him. There's hardly any question that he has the talent to be a major impact player in the league, but concerns about his attitude, focus, and issues off the court cast a shadow over that potential, and that’s definitely a complication. But the Miami Heat acted like many teams do—thinking, “Sure, he’s in hot water now, but he’s got serious talent. If we brought him into our setup, I bet we could fix him right up.” Turns out, that’s not how it works. The NBA actually runs a rookie camp to teach players how to stay out of trouble. Beast decided to hang out with women and ended up causing chaos by setting off the hotel fire alarm at 2 a.m. because he was smoking weed. Then, right before his second NBA season was about to start, he checked into rehab. He also posted some alarming messages online, like, "Feeling like it's not worth living. I'm done." He asked, "Are there any pictures of Michael Beasley that aren't basically potential crime scenes, which was totally true in year two?" It’s like if Chad Holglen entered the NBA not long ago, but instead of working towards a championship, he’s just out partying with strippers and then OKC trades him. That’s exactly what the Heat did before Beasley’s third year. He told the Timberwolves, "I'm done getting into trouble." But behind the scenes, it was only getting worse. Beasley recalls that right after a game where he blocked Kobe Bryant’s shot, he checked his bank account and saw that it said... He ended up with zero dollars. Beasley later revealed that his personal accountant had embezzled everything from him, which actually happens more often in the NBA than people realize. But Beasley's situation wasn’t just about bad luck. It seemed more like a pattern or a cycle. He’d go through periods of promising starts, then spiral into chaos. He would say all the right things, and teams would… Trust in his talent, and everything would seem fine at first. But then it all unraveled, just like in Minnesota. He kicked things off strong, staying out of trouble for nearly a year, keeping his nose clean the entire time. That is until one night around 3 a.m., when police pulled him over for doing 85 in a 65. They found 16 grams of weed in his possession, and that's when it all fell apart. The car. The NBA was in a lockout at the time, so technically he wasn’t facing any immediate penalties, but financially things were starting to fall apart. He ended up suing his longtime agent and kept bouncing from team to team in the league. The Suns probably made a reckless move and handed him an $18 million deal, calling it “a fresh start.” And then, just six months later… He felt a wave of regret wash over him. Once more, he was speeding, this time without license plates or registration, and a loaded gun sat on the console. But for Michael Beasley, it wasn’t just about one major mistake or a scandal that blew up. It was more like a steady stream of warning signs, little red flags popping up all the time. So, by the time he reached the place, Beasley went from being a top-tier prospect to pretty much a joke in many people’s eyes. Everyone still remembers that shorts incident—when he tried to check in wearing the wrong pair, had to dash all the way back to the locker room at halftime, and the whole thing went viral. People just cracked up over it, but what nobody realized was that his mom… He had just died, and on the same day, his cousin also passed away during the game. Beasley later reflected, "The whole world was laughing at me. It hurt my feelings, I won’t hide that. He was falling apart, but the NBA wasn’t going to wait forever. So after the pandemic, the league" Michael Beasley finished his stint, and right around then, all the other leagues went dark. Nothing from China, where he had that impressive 47-point game, no European action, no G-League outings. By the time he hit 30, all we were left with were those summer videos — him without a shirt, shooting hoops casually with other former players like John. Wall still had that presence, even if he wasn’t at his peak. In 2021, Bee made a memorable appearance shirtless while cooking guys up and dropped the phrase, "I'm him." Before that, no one had really said it like that. It was fresh, new, and everyone caught on. "I'm here. I'm here." But the tough part is, right after that game, he’d head out of the gym and... He would just head straight to his car, where he spent every night. For two years, Beasley was basically homeless, with no real plan because the money was all gone. Fifty million dollars had been stolen—by his own accountant and family. I remember him saying, "I was sleeping in my car." That was his reality during those tough times. What I want to say is that I went from crying out for help to trying to handle things myself. I was hurting, no doubt about it. But then, tomorrow arrived, and I just couldn’t let the day beat me down, you get what I mean? Through all that time, that whole period, you were there with me. You kept playing basketball. Why? Yeah, I kept going. Why? Someone’s gotta handle the ball, dribble it around. Why not me? Well, why not him—that’s what the guys in the big three league were probably wondering too. Luckily, Bees was still in good shape because when they called him up, he quickly laced up his shoes and headed out. He was out there chasing revenge. Bees showed up and dominated the Miami 305 squad, putting up averages of 23 points and 7 rebounds, plus two assists. Now he's snagging back-to-back MVP awards and has become pretty much the face of the league. The dude was clearly prepared. But that’s not the only way Michael Beasley is stacking his cash these days in his comeback run. Some players head overseas, but… Bees noticed a new opportunity that seemed just right for him. He's always been known as one of the top one-on-one players out there. In fact, Tom Habistro mentioned that during Bees’ second run in Miami, he used to consistently take down some of the best players. During those Miami practice sessions, LeBron James and Michael Beasley would go head-to-head regularly. Beasley would always come out on top against LeBron; he's that talented. He's so skilled, it’s almost unfair. Even the guys at Gills Arena mentioned that if you took the star players from today and put them up against 36-year-old Beasley in his prime, they'd be shaking in their shoes. There’s really no one in the league—or even from the past—who would dare challenge him at his position. I’d bet on that without hesitation. One of those NBA players isn’t about to risk his career over someone else. Nope. If he were to say, "Ruy, hey, let me play you for your spot on the team, and I get in," they'd be like, "Nah, I’m good." No way they’d do it. He’d just say, "Yeah, so what do you think?" and that’s it. That’s the end of it. That's nuts. But seriously, how do you even turn that into cash? There’s this platform called The Next Chapter that’s planning to host Beasley going head-to-head with Lance Stevenson in a one-on-one match for a hundred grand. The tricky part is getting enough people to tune in and watch it. Seems like the whole thing might fall flat because, let’s be honest, Michael Beasley isn’t exactly the most reliable or skilled player out there. talker and it gets kind of crazy. Make sure you get a bigger shirt. We going to be in there. I ain't wearing no shirt. Cool. Better get to them nipples. I'm going to make you dance, Lance. We going to get straight to it. I'mma bring my dancing shoes. I'm about to take over that court. I’m not scared or nervous or anything. Nah. So, those two players faced off, but Beasley pretty much crushed Lance Stevenson. I’m talking 31-21, and honestly, it wasn’t even that tight. After that, Beasley has been calling out Joe Johnson and Carmelo Anthony lately. But whatever goes down, Michael Beasley keeps doing his thing. He managed to regain his respect and found a way to play on his own terms in the league. But there's another player from that same era who’s still in the NBA despite facing some tough times. Andre Drummond went from being the heartbeat of a franchise to hanging around the margins of the league. He doesn’t mind at all. In fact, he’s pretty glad that things turned out this way because now Drummond has the chance to show other young players how to avoid making the same errors he did.
