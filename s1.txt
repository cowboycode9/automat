The real puzzling thing about this NBA gambling scandal is why someone earning 24 million dollars a year would jeopardize everything for a small prop bet payout. I mean, we all assumed guys like Terozier were probably above getting caught up in stuff like this. But now, it turns out we finally know what pushed him over the edge. What the NBA did after discovering all this might actually be even more problematic, and if it’s true, it honestly makes them look way worse than they already do. But let’s shift back to Rosier for a moment. We can understand why someone like Jonte Porter might have chosen to act the way he did. He was… So, making 400K a year and then some shady character comes along with a payday offer. Might sound tempting, but really? What’s going on with Terry Rosier? How did it all come to this? Turns out, the FBI just revealed who his accomplice was. And now, shifting gears, I’m taking today’s sponsor, Viori, out into the real world because I know it looks good, too. Feels great, but does it perform well? Turns out, it does. I already suspected as much. I’ve been a Viori fan for years now. One of my go-to pieces this season is the Ponto Performance Crew. It’s a lightweight, long-sleeve crew neck, perfect for chilly workout days. And it’s got that… Dream Knit fabric, made from a buttery-soft performance stretch material that dries quickly and pulls moisture away from your skin. Plus, there's that handy little side zip stash pocket, ideal for securing a key or a card during your workout. When I start to feel a bit warm, I switch to the Strat T. It's the softest performance tee I’ve ever worn. Game. They’re lightweight, breathable, and wick moisture, making them ideal for both training and casual wear. The core short has that perfect fit I want—just above the knee, athletic cut, great for working out. I really like Viori because their style is inspired by Coastal California, which totally matches my vibe, but they’re crafted to be both functional and stylish. Stay comfortable and feel good whether I’m hitting the gym or just relaxing at home watching games. To find out more, visit viorieclo.com through the link in the description or scan the QR code.

Back in high school, we used to play sports together. One day, this guy comes over to Rosier and asks for a favor. He’s like, "Hey, if you can give me any info, a guy just called me saying he’d give me a hundred thousand dollars." Terra was probably like, "Alright, yeah, I got you." He thought to himself, "It's late March, just a few games left in the season and we're definitely out of the playoffs. What's the worst that could happen if I fake an injury? I mean, I could even hook up my childhood best friend with a hundred grand if I pull this off just once." It seemed like a no-brainer at the time, but it turned out to be a terrible decision because he did it. So, that friend, Dairo Lester, passed the info to this guy Marvis Bailey, who’s known as a sketchy gambler. Why do you think he was ready to drop a hundred thousand dollars? That move sparked a whole underground gambling scene that spread throughout the country. Take Shane Hannon, for example—he put in over 61,200 bucks into it. Rosier Unders. Co-conspirator 27K. Timothy McCormack and Long Fee Fam 41K. Co-conspirator 3 with 20K. Four others at 17K. Number five, 12,500. Then there are two guys each under 4K. Rosier had no idea, but he confided in his childhood friend that once spread was involved, it became way easier to catch them. I mean, with 200K in bets, it’s pretty obvious how the system got cracked. It was a Thursday night during a Hornets game. How obvious could it be? And just how much did they actually profit from it? I’ve come across articles online claiming stuff like, "This is the moment Teroisier threw a game for 200K." But he didn’t actually earn 200K. That kind of reporting is so lazy. There’s been a ton of misinformation floating around about all this. The coverage of this story is really off. It's crazy how they got it all wrong. The mistake they made was thinking that 200,000 was bet on the under, but that’s not the case. Rosier didn’t make 200,000 himself. So, what did Dairo last actually walk away with? He was promised 100K, right? But in reality, it was less than that. According to the FBI, it was probably just tens of thousands of dollars, not anything close to 100K. About 20K. So he takes it over to Rosier's place, counts out the cash. Honestly, I have no idea if Rosier even pocketed any of it. He might have just been like, "Nah, man, you keep it." But that’s how someone earning 24 million dollars can end up caught up in a mess like this. And Guys like him could easily find themselves in the same boat. They’ve got plenty of friends from back home who could influence things. But Rosier’s story is a clear cautionary tale. One wrong move and his whole life could be turned upside down. Some people claim he’s underperformed in other games, but really, it all comes down to that one game right here. {"annotations":[],"refusal":null,"role":"assistant"} He put his house up as collateral for bail just over one game? That’s wild enough on its own. But what the NBA did after that might take it even further. If this story checks out, Adam Silver could be in serious hot water. There’s a bit of a conspiracy twist to all this, so hang tight and follow along. It all began on January 20th, 2025, the day we first found out Rosier was in trouble. The league announced, “Back in March 2023, the NBA was notified about suspicious betting patterns involving Terry Rosier. We launched an investigation and didn’t find any breach of NBA regulations, but…” So, just a heads-up: we’re aware there's an investigation being carried out by the US attorney’s office, and we’re fully cooperating with it. Basically, it’s like, yeah, you might hear that the feds are looking into Terry Rosier. We already knew that, though. Just wanted to keep you in the loop. And yeah, I get it—why didn’t we tell you earlier? They kept it all quiet for nearly two years. Actually, Rosier pretended to be hurt during that game on March 23. Here’s Terry coming off a screen, knocking down a nice mid-range shot. Everything looks smooth. Then suddenly, he checks his ankle, steps away from the play, leaves the court, no sign of a limp. But interestingly, the sports books flagged it to the NBA right away. Here’s a fresh take on it: Within hours of this happening, there are a ton of Rosier prop bets popping up for a Thursday Hornets game. Definitely worth taking a look at. The NBA has officially pulled Rosier from the rest of the season. There were only eight games left, but it’s not due to any injury. That injury was completely fabricated. There was an NBA investigation, and somehow they knew about it but didn't say a word. I get why they might have kept quiet from the public perspective — if it turned out to be completely untrue, they wouldn't want to ruin Terry’s reputation forever. But what really gets me is that they still let him get traded to the... Miami Heat are dealing with this situation. Seriously? Can you imagine how furious I’d be if I were the Heat’s GM or a fan? Conduct an investigation into illegal gambling and then keep us in the dark? Now, Adam Silver has been asked about it, and all he says is that the NBA doesn't have… They don't have subpoena power. They can't threaten to lock anyone up. All they could do was look at Terry's phone and have a talk with him. So, everything is straightforward there. If Terry ends up guilty, at least they did everything within their reach. But it feels strange that they didn't inform the Heat about any of this. Why? Well, it might be worth considering that… Seems like Silver might have swept the scandal under the rug for now to keep the league looking good. You can tell by how he brushed off the Kawaii news— totally casual, like it was no big deal. Honestly, what won’t this guy try to hide? All he seems to care about is raking in cash for the NBA. And it turns out, the league actually found out about everything too. So, the Rosier situation pops up on March 23, and then he drops the news about the new media rights deal in July 2024. Throughout all that time, he never said a word, kept everyone in the dark. Why? It’s pretty clear he was holding it close for a reason. I can practically picture Adam Silver catching wind of it and being like, "Hey, this can’t go public just yet." Like, he knew something was about to happen, maybe even that a deal was in the works, and needed to keep things under wraps until everything was ready to go. Seems like a classic move to avoid leaks right before a big signing, you know? The deal was worth $75 billion. Of course, I can't definitively prove any of the motives behind it; all I have are the facts and the timeline. So, really, you're the one who has to make the call. But one thing's clear—Miami Heat definitely cares about this. Do you think they could somehow reverse the trade since Rosier has been absolutely terrible for them? In fact, he's pretty terrible—so much so that in game one, he was actually available to play, but they kept him out of the rotation because he’s that bad. Maybe they’re hoping to get some salary cap relief out of it, I suppose. But honestly, if I were in their shoes, I’d be more focused on the pick. They traded a… Getting the first pick sent to Charlotte, huh? If I were Miami, I’d be doing everything I could to reclaim that. But there’s something else that just came to light about those mafia poker games. The FBI claims that Chanty Bilips lured wealthy folks into these rigged games to drain their bank accounts. But… Wow, the mafia’s really struggling if the top celebrity they could get for their shady poker game is Chanty Bilips. I can't imagine Scorsese making a compelling film out of this mess. Or maybe not. Pablo Tory mentions that Kevin Garnett also took part in one of these secret games. A Actually, the number of ex-pro athletes involved is real, and I hate to say it, but it’s true. No way around it. Kevin Garnett, who earned more than 300 million during his career, was aware that this entire game was crooked and even tied to the mafia. According to the FBI, these shady bets and rigged games snatched around 7 million dollars in total. So, what’s KG going to do about it now? Are you concerned about that? Maybe Chanty didn’t realize it either. If Chanty Bilips is innocent, I’m sorry about that. His main mistake was sharing information with Damon Jones. Honestly, that’s the only new detail we got from the entire FBI press conference. Damon. Jones, who used to be an assistant coach, was caught selling insider information. We already knew about Terzier’s involvement. Regardless, this incident paints a really bad picture for the NBA. There’s already a lingering suspicion that some games are fixed, and now this just fuels those fears. Adam Silver really needs to step in before things spiral into an even bigger scandal. But when it comes to the actual basketball on the court… It’s been incredible so far—definitely one of the best season starts I can recall in ages. The Rockets’ game one was fantastic, but it did highlight a pretty big weakness for Houston. Even with KD on the team, there’s still something holding them back unless they pull off another huge trade.
