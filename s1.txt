The NBA might have cleared Terry Rozier, but the FBI isn’t so convinced. That guy’s pretty much done for good—won’t be stepping back onto an NBA court again, just like Jonte Porter. Chanty Bilips is in the same boat. And wait until you hear what he did that’s got everyone talking—something involving Damian Lillard that nobody’s really bringing up yet. But... There are two separate situations just revealed, both involving NBA players and coaches. We already knew about the first one, but now there are some fresh details, including illegal betting tied to the Los Angeles Lakers. The second case is completely new. It centers around a poker game where Chanty Bilips took part. So, who… Cares? It’s poker, or at least it was supposed to be. But it was more than just a game. These were rigged matches tied to the mafia. When players didn’t settle up, threats of violence were common. They even held a guy at gunpoint when he refused to give them what they demanded. But the real question is, is Chanty truly guilty? Well, can you... About two years back, a professional poker player named Chanty mentioned on his podcast that he believed the game was rigged, though he couldn’t actually prove it. There was this particular game that began in Los Angeles and then moved to Vegas for a few days. It was all centered around this... Chanty Bilips, it seems pretty clear he was definitely caught cheating, but there's just no way to do anything about it. It's really hard, especially when you're dealing with someone high-profile like that, because he’s already beaten the charges. You’d think calling him a cheater would matter to him? Yeah, right. Just wow. And that’s the tough part. That was two years ago. Chanty’s done for. But honestly, those two situations aren’t really linked. So, why bring them up together? And why now? Some folks are suggesting the FBI’s favoritism has a bias against the NBA, implying they’re trying to send a message or send some sort of warning. They mentioned they wouldn’t be heading to the White House after winning a championship. Huh. The FBI director was actually asked about that directly. But let’s focus on the sports betting issue first, since that’s the bigger story affecting the league. Apparently, inside information was used to place bets. Jonte Porter was involved with the Hornets, Magic, Blazers, Lakers, and Raptors. We already knew about the Raptors, of course. Sportsbooks picked up on some strange betting activity around Porter's underprops, which was a big warning sign. They tipped off the authorities, leading to several arrests. Porter then explained that he had told his associates about… He was planning to head out of the game early so his bet could pay off. Now, the FBI claims Rosier did the very same thing. On March 23rd, 2023, during a game while he was with the Hornets, Rosier told folks he was leaving early because around $200,000 worth of bets had gone through successfully. But what about… Those other teams— the Blazers, the Magic, the Lakers—well, the FBI has revealed that Rosier and Damon Jones, who used to be an assistant coach, were involved in some shady dealings. The details say they used insider information. Specifically, they took advantage of their connections with coaches and players they've known for a while to pass along betting tips. Damon Jones, in particular, was part of this situation. A teammate of LeBron’s back in Cleveland, then later he coached him in 2016. He was actually LeBron’s personal shooting coach. So, this guy finds out that LeBron is planning to sit out against the Bucks last year. And sure enough, when game time comes, no Braun on the court. That bet pays off. Then he gets some intel on Anthony Davis. And… What happens next is pretty amusing. According to the indictment, he found out from AD's trainer that AD would be unavailable for the game against the Thunder on February 9th. After that, he texts a guy named Eric Ernest, who then pays Jones $2,500 for this inside info. Ernest then... So, Ernest tells this other guy to place a $100,000 wager against the Lakers. But then AD not only suits up but also racks up his usual minutes and has a fantastic game. The Lakers end up winning, so Ernest’s bet falls apart. Later, Ernest shoots a message to Damon Jones saying, “What the heck? I want my money back.” But Jones… If Rosier had that info, he would know which players wouldn’t be on the court for the Blazers on March 24, 2023. Everyone also expected that every Magic starter would sit out on April 6. The FBI revealed that details about who wouldn't play came from a Magic player connected to a defendant, and that it was tied to betting. Chanty also shared information with that same gambling connection connected to his own team, the Blazers. This details from the FBI on March 24, 2023, confirm it. Before the game against the Bulls, the Blazers had a record of 32 and 40 and were out of playoff contention. Co-conspirator 8 is Chanty. I mentioned to the defendant, Eric Ernest, that the Trailblazers were planning to tank. Bibs let Ernest know before it was officially announced that several of the team's top players, including player one, wouldn’t be participating in that game. I noticed Damen Lillard was among those sitting out. That was the first game I remember that happening. He stayed seated whenever the team started to struggle. The details about which players they’d be benching, especially Damen Lillard, weren’t out in the open. So, he ended up sharing insider info on his own squad. That’s a serious no-no, lifetime ban territory. On top of that, he got caught up in some mafia-style poker game, and the way everything unfolded was pretty wild. So basically, ex-athletes were used to attract these fish, who are pretty much like wealthy older guys with a lot of money, hoping to compete against the former pros. And the FBI claims that Chanty was responsible for drawing these guys in, but the mafia already had the entire setup fixed. They already had a heads-up on everyone’s cards at the table. The way they pulled it off was pretty clever—they used a tampered shuffler, along with an X-ray setup that could see through the cards when they were laid out. Plus, there was a camera hidden inside the chip holder. All that information was then sent out to whoever was controlling it. They explained everything to the folks at the table and laid out exactly how to play the game. Essentially, they managed to pull off a scam that netted around 7 million dollars from these inexperienced guys, often referred to as “fish.” This is a major story, especially since it involves a lot of NBA players. Now, people are wondering why some are calling it political. Well, to understand that, let’s begin with the background. The NBA as a league hasn’t exactly been the biggest supporter of this administration, you know? Back in 2017, the Warriors were the first team to turn down a visit to the White House after winning their championship, with Trump in office. And when it comes to Trump, coaches like Steve Kerr and Greg Popovich often speak out quite openly and aren’t shy about expressing their opinions. Him. At one point, Pop called him a soulless coward and even described him as a quote pathetic individual. Someone small who tries to bring everyone else down so he can feel taller. Not exactly a glowing review. That’s not very kind, but during the pandemic, the NBA was definitely the most vocal league out there, which... That led Trump to describe them as essentially a political entity. The idea is that he’s now targeting them because they’ve been criticizing him for years. But where’s the proof of that? The thing is, these are two totally different situations. The mafia was the one running the poker game, not the other group in question. That prop betting situation was really just a bunch of shady gamblers in action. The link was Phillips and Damon Jones—they look like two dodgy friends getting into some questionable stuff. But the FBI spins it as if it’s some major NBA conspiracy. Today, we’re in New York to reveal something truly historic. There’s been a big crackdown on a sprawling criminal operation that apparently involves both the NBA and Lacosa Nostra. Yeah, Lacosa Nostra is the mafia. The person linking them is suggesting that these two groups are connected somehow, like they’re working together. But in reality, these are two entirely separate investigations. Still, when asked about it again, he responded with this. This is the story of insider trading involving the NBA. What’s going on with the sports betting or those poker games? Why wouldn’t you clarify that difference unless you’re aiming to give the NBA a bad rap? It certainly seems like the FBI’s trying to cast a negative shadow over the league here. Absolutely no doubt about it. Honestly, what other reason could there be for doing this now? The Roier investigation has been going on for two years, and it’s only wrapping up right as the season begins. At the same time, these guys seem incredibly guilty. You’ve got a coach, a Hall of Famer, and another player all involved. It’s pretty hard to ignore how suspicious that looks. Banned for life, that’s the unfortunate outcome. I get it when folks say legal gambling is to blame, but the truth is, shady dealings have been happening for years. We only started hearing about this because of legal betting. For example, sportsbooks caught Jonte Porter and underreported it to the FBI—that kind of thing has never happened before we had legalized gambling. It’s all underground, out of sight until the cracks start to show. So, turns out this whole situation runs a lot deeper and is way more complicated than we initially realized. We’ll just have to wait and see if more names get revealed once these guys start chatting with the FBI. But hey, on a lighter note—how about some good news? The NBA season is finally underway, and the Rockets looked pretty good out there. Even with Kevin Durant having a bit of a rough start… Off the record, it seems like they’re just one move away from really being in the contest. So, what kind of deal could they pull off to make that happen?
