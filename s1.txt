It's pretty clear why everyone admires Russell Westbrook. The man's worth at least 300 million dollars, probably more like nearly half a billion. Yet, instead of relaxing on his yacht, he's out there balling, getting ready for the season. And all he's going to get in return is just a veteran's welcome. He's not chasing this for the cash. It’s all about the passion for the game. But at the moment, the game isn’t showing him any love. No NBA teams have reached out to sign Russell Westbrook. He could even start the season without a team, despite being a Hall of Famer who has given so much to the sport. That technical foul from last season takes the cake. Hanging on the rim and basically telling his former team to head home—seriously, it was hilarious and totally entertaining. So, what's really going on there? Well, it all ties back to what I call the Hall of Famer paradox, something we saw with guys like Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson. How's that? Well, before… So here’s the deal: there’s one team that’s potentially interested in signing Russ. The Sacramento Kings are showing some interest, but they’re kind of stuck because they don’t currently have a spot on their roster. If they can swing a trade involving Malik Monk or Devin Carter, then they could make room for Russ. But why would they do that? It’s totally the Kings move—on brand for them. They’re like the kings of the unexpected, always pulling off the most surprising, sometimes wild, moves. The Chicago Bulls of the West are pretty much an average to below-average squad that can’t seem to decide what they want to be. Right now, they’re all about going all-in on players who are in their prime or just past it, trying to chase a quick fix. You’ve got guys like Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, and Domantas Sabonis leading the way, but according to ESPN, they’re projected to end up around 12th place next year. It feels like they’re caught in the middle—neither rebuilding nor contending fully—just sort of limping along without a clear direction. Kings took one look at Lavine and DeRozan getting knocked out in Chicago’s first round and thought, “Hey, let’s do the same in the West, and hey, let’s add three years to their ages while we’re at it. That’ll definitely turn out great.” Their solution was to sign 37-year-old Russell Westbrook. I’ve got to say, I’m a fan of the move, but it does feel like a gamble. So, Russ is actually just playing the waiting game right now, letting the season get underway and having teams come to him. Right now, there are teams like the Warriors, Knicks, Sixers, and Timberwolves with open roster spots. What if Minnesota looks at Rob Dillingham and realizes he’s not quite prepared to take over as the full-time backup to Mike Conley at point guard? What if one of those other teams hits a snag with injuries and suddenly needs more point guard depth? But honestly, the real talking point is the Denver Nuggets. Last season, he was outstanding. And as many expected, Nola Joic really helped Russ thrive last year. He put up averages of 13 points and six assists, making a noticeable impact. Votes came in for Six Man of the Year, and Russ definitely made an impression — hitting a clutch shot to push Game 1 into overtime against the Clippers, and then tossing the perfect pass to Aaron Gordon to seal the win. But when the season ended, Duke opted out of a $3.5 million player option. Denver wasn't having it, though — they basically said, “You're not going anywhere.” To score a better deal with us, I’d say good luck navigating the open market, my friend. But why bother? We already know Russ isn’t the most efficient player and struggles on defense. Still, the Nuggets discovered something else about Westbrook. No matter how many incredible plays he made in that game… In the first round, he definitely had a couple of really rough games, like two or three that just didn't go his way. Then, in the second round against the Thunder, Russell Westbrook posted a mind-blowing minus 92 plus-minus. His overall numbers were pretty underwhelming too—just 10 points per game, two assists, and three turnovers. He shot only 35% from the field and a meager 22% from three. You see, Russ might be… People try to call him a sixth man, but that’s just not him. It’s like impossible for a guy like Russ. Whenever he steps on the court, everyone can tell. He’s engaged in every single play, whether it’s a good moment or a bad one. He just doesn’t have that roleplayer mindset to be a sixth man, and honestly, that’s a good thing when you think about it. Last year, the plan for the Nuggets was pretty straightforward: let Russ handle the second unit and just let him do his thing. But what happens if you actually have other options and more depth? Well, Russ isn’t really that guy. That’s why, this off-season, the Nuggets moved on from Michael Porter Jr. and Dario Sarge. But in… Cam Johnson, Bruce Brown, Jonas Valentunis, and Tim Hardaway Jr.—they’ve really strengthened the roster and don't need Russ anymore. But that’s not even the half of it. Remember the fight Russ had with Aaron Gordon? After that Clippers game 2, ESPN put out a report mentioning there was a... There was a pretty intense argument in the locker room. Gordon called out Russ about his attitude, and when someone asked why Gordon might have acted that way, a player explained it. He said, "He's just so immature," referring to Westbrook. Wow. After all that, Gordon ended up speaking with the media on camera, stepping in to defend Russ. Russ. He's definitely one of the most gifted basketball players to ever step on the court. But that conversation was just between us, nobody else. Did you catch that he didn’t really deny what the article said? He just said it was unfair. And honestly, I see his point. I mean, it’s pretty clear where he stands. ESPN probably just threw that out there to stir up some buzz and controversy. But honestly, the core truth hasn't changed: there was a personality clash, and another teammate ended up calling Russell out behind his back. The thing is, even if Russ is officially labeled as the sixth man, he's not like any other sixth man in the league. On the court and in the locker room, this guy just exudes total alpha energy—number one kind of leadership vibe. But honestly, that’s not really what you want from a role player. The way Russ is finishing up his stint kind of reminds me of two other players. The first one is Allen Iverson. Even back then, he was still a Would you like me to continue with the rest of the comparison? Force was a legendary figure in his 30s—a true cultural icon. When his explosiveness started to fade, he wasn’t about to settle for a lesser role. That led him to stints with the Nuggets, the Pistons, and the Grizzlies. The departure from those teams was complicated and difficult, pretty painful all around. On the other side, there’s Carmelo Anthony, a 10-time all-star, but once his defensive skills took a hit… And his ball movement didn't quite align with the style of today's NBA, plus he had a tough time when he was asked to play a smaller role, which made things toxic. In fact, for an entire year, no team showed interest in Melo. It wasn't because he couldn't put the ball in the basket, but because he wasn’t fitting into anyone’s system. The key difference with Russell Westbrook is that he's accepted a reduced role, but his... Style doesn’t really suit him as a role player. He’s just too impactful. The Hall of Famer paradox is about someone who’s clearly not finished but also too complex to keep in the mix. The wild part? The NBA’s view of Russ actually kicked off way earlier than most people realize. A while back, have you ever thought about how Russ went from being a consensus star to someone you just can't get a win with seemingly overnight? How did it all change so quickly? Well, back in the early days, Russ’s reputation was closely tied to Kevin Durant during his first eight years in the NBA. In those years, Russ managed to win rookie of the year and establish himself as a key player. In 2017, Russ was shining bright—five-time All-Star and making it to the NBA Finals. But after KD took off for Golden State, Russ started to show his cracks. I remember hearing someone say this pretty early on—Colin Cowherd, the ESPN radio host. The guy’s like a convertible sports car—looks flashy, but maybe not the most reliable under pressure. The NBA is full of stars. He’s got charm, he’s got looks, and he’s totally eye-catching. But I think he can be pretty useless when it really counts. Don’t just get caught up in the numbers, fanboy. Pay attention to Westbrook during those high-pressure moments, in the tough games. That’s what I’ve always said about John Wall. Wall was that fiery, unpredictable player. And back then, that’s exactly how he showed up. It was once seen as somewhat out of line, but a few years down the road, everyone started using that phrase. It just became common talk about Russ. And speaking of Colin Coward, that guy pulled the same stunt with Carmelo Anthony years earlier. He can’t hide from his true nature—a ball hog. Wow, I really Would you like me to continue or adjust the tone further? Back in 2013, I was letting people know that going against the grain was the move. After KD left the Thunder, the story about Russ started to change. Folks pushed back just like they did with Camarlo, but over time, the numbers and the actual facts started to back me up. Like, forget the noise, you know? Look at the story behind it. The truth is, the Thunder sent Russ packing in 2019 to kick off their rebuild. Since then, he’s jumped around to five different teams, with a sixth likely on the horizon, never staying more than two years in one spot. And ever since Kevin Durant left him, Russ has… Russ has had seven first-round exits and only managed to get past the opening round twice. Since Kevin Durant left him in 2016, his performance and story have taken a downward turn. Now, for the first time in his Hall of Fame-caliber career, it looks like the NBA might be starting to look past him. Speaking of career surprises, have you heard about that NBA starter in his prime who suddenly decided to walk away from the game? He even handed back millions to his team just so he could quit the NBA altogether. It’s one of those wildest stories in recent NBA history because almost… Nobody would have guessed he was going to make that choice. So, what pushed Larry Sanders to walk away from the league unexpectedly? There were lots of theories floating around, but once the real story surfaced, it completely changed everything we thought we knew.
