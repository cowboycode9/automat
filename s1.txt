So, the Memphis Grizzlies actually suspended one of their players because he was causing a distraction. Ring a bell? It kind of reminds me of when the Heat did the same with Jimmy Butler. You know, Jimmy Ghost, always talking trash to the media, gets suspended by the Heat. And look what happened next—just about a month and a half later, he was with a different team. Funny how that works out, huh? Exactly the same thing just happened to John Morant. The Grizzlies ended up losing to the Lakers, and this picture captures it perfectly. J looks like he’s doing his own thing, completely detached. His effort was pretty bad throughout the game, only managing eight points, and he seemed to be pouting on the court. So, coach Tumas Eelo… He called out Jaw right in front of the entire team, saying, "You quit on your teammates." Basically, he questioned Jaw's leadership and effort in front of everyone. So, how did Jaw respond? Not well at all. Then, he just walks right up to a microphone and asks, "What went wrong for you today? A glass of..." So, do you think there's anything you might have done differently? I get the feeling he's upset about it. From what they told me, they probably weren’t interested in playing me honestly. That was pretty much the main message I took away. Not great news, huh? Anyway, the Grizzlies suspended Ja for conduct detrimental to the team. Team Sham is saying that other squads are now going to keep a close eye on how everything unfolds. But what’s Jaw really annoyed about? And what might a trade even involve? Still, basketball is back. And honestly, the best way to figure out if my hometown Rockets are in the market for a point guard is to see how they play this season.

Ever since Jaw was labeled as a possible face of the league, his career’s gone downhill fast. There was that overconfident fine he received in the West. Then, off the court, he got suspended for 33 games in 2023 over firearms. Last year, things only seemed to escalate. Getting a fine for making gun gestures in a game. And people tend to brush it off, saying, "Oh, it’s no big deal," but honestly, it’s not really mature. Plus, when you're talking about a superstar, the last thing you want is for them to display that kind of behavior. Talent is important, sure, but maturity matters just as much, if not more. A winner, whether it’s Tim Duncan or Steph Curry, teams tend to overlook a little immaturity from a superstar. But lately, Ja Morant isn’t fitting that mold. He made the All-Star team in 2022 and 2023, then just disappeared. It’s like he’s finally coming back down to earth. So, what’s going on? Sham reports that Ja’s unhappy with the... The new coach went over his rotations and plays just like they did last year, but with a different leader guiding the team. Last season, Memphis introduced a new offense that basically didn’t involve much pick and roll at all. If you watch a typical NBA team, they’re constantly screening and running those plays. But Memphis decided, “Nah, that’s not our style.” Instead, they had five guys essentially playing a different game. Check this out. Led the NBA in drives, but it annoyed Jarant. The Athletics mentioned, "Some days Jaw seems eager and engaged, other days he looks like he’d rather be anywhere else because he hates the offense." Before long, the coach… I got fired. That’s how it goes sometimes, but let’s talk about basketball. Taylor Jenkins, one of the winningest coaches in Grizzlies history, was the guy at the helm. Now, they’ve promoted this European coach named Tumas Eelo. The situation has somewhat improved, but it still doesn’t feel like enough. One noticeable change is Jaw playing in pick-and-roll situations more often this year. His touches have increased from 68 per game last season to about 76 now. Last year's game, but here’s an interesting twist. Jaw is still well below his prime when it comes to pick and roll. When Dune was an All-Star, he was getting around 12 or 13 touches per game in those situations. Now, that number has dropped to about 8 and a half. So, yeah, it’s clear the coach is giving Jaw some room to operate. Jaw kind of shrugs, like he’s a little disappointed but not surprised. The numbers don’t really show a huge difference from last year, so it’s not as much as he was hoping. He looks over and says, “Don’t you want me to stand out? Don’t you want me to play my game and be an all-star?” He pauses, almost expecting a different answer. “Isn’t that gonna help the team?” And he’s just patiently waiting for the response. But here’s a thought—do you genuinely want your entire offense to revolve around Jaw, as if he’s the game’s main star like Luca Doncic or Giannis? Or are you aiming for a more balanced approach, like the Thunder or Celtics, where everyone gets a shot and the scoring isn’t just one guy’s show? Because the issue with Jaw is… He might be talented, but he's small, struggles on defense, won't be shooting well in 2025, and isn’t really someone you can count on. With all the suspensions and injuries, Jaw has missed about a third of what he could have contributed to the Memphis Grizzlies. So, every third game, he’s not on the court. Do you honestly want to base your team’s future on that? About that? No way. The new coach and the front office are gradually expanding the team's game beyond Jaw, and he’s having a hard time with it. If the offense isn’t all about him like it used to be, he just won’t fully commit. Doesn’t matter if… So, essentially, he’s either going to land a max contract or become the cornerstone of the team. Now, the Grizzlies are stuck with a tough choice. Do they hang tight and hope Jaw changes his mind about staying, or do they consider trading him? That might sound out there, but remember, this is the same franchise that recently traded Desmond Bane. That season, Bane was 27 years old and their top shooter, and they ended up letting him go. The Magic pulled it off by completely crushing the Grizzlies with their offer. They sent over Cole Anthony, KCP, and control of five first-round picks. So, what’s John Morant really worth? And who might step up to make that happen? Maybe get him? Honestly, I think it’d surprise a lot of folks just how awful this trade package could turn out to be. Think about it—he’s a little guard who struggles to shoot and doesn’t do much on defense, plus he’s got off-court drama hanging over him, like that Divike incident. Now he’s on a max contract during this second apron era. That’s a nightmare waiting to happen. The Grizzlies are in a tough spot with Jaw—they can’t really afford to sell him off cheap, but they also don’t want to keep him if it means risking more trouble. So, it’s either take the hit and get less in the trade or hope he pans out and ride with him. The question is, who’s actually willing to take that chance on a player like Jaw? Most folks would probably think about teams that need a point guard and might be desperate enough to roll the dice. So, we’re talking about the Houston Rockets, the Dallas Mavericks, and right now, the Milwaukee Bucks. But I’d also throw in the idea of desperation into the mix. Like, a team that's really eager and willing to take a chance on Ja—despite all the flaws we’ve been discussing. They see the potential, believe that with a fresh start, Ja can bounce back and get back to where he was. That's some all-star caliber play right there. So, who do you think that might be? The first guys that come to mind are the Phoenix Suns, getting Jaw for Jaylen Green and gaining control of two first-round picks. It does feel like they’re selling a bit low on Jaw in that deal, but that 2032 swap could turn out to be incredibly valuable down the line. Now, Jaylen’s current salary is significantly less than Jaw’s maximum, yet he’s a much more accurate shooter and considerably younger. Still, Memphis fans probably wouldn’t be thrilled with that trade. The other team you might be thinking about is the Sacramento Kings. They could potentially trade for Jaw by offering Malik Monk, Dennis Schröder, and control over three first-round picks. And… Those are solid options, especially outside of the one from San Antonio. Monk could step in to make up some of the scoring Bane might have taken away. Dennis Schröder also brings ball-handling help to fill in for Jaw. The Kings are doing this because, realistically, how else are they going to land that All-Star caliber talent in Sacramento? It doesn’t seem like they’re planning to rebuild anytime soon. On that note, you might look at teams like the Raptors, especially considering how rough things have gotten in Toronto. Then there are the Timberwolves, who are really in need of someone to fill the gap left by Mike Conley. And of course, the Blazers—they’re going to need some top-tier talent if they’re ever going to turn things around. Ignore the plan, but what if we blow it up? Some folks have said, "Hey, if Memphis is going to trade Jaw, they might as well just start fresh." Nah. The thing that makes Memphis special right now, and what’s making it tough for Jaw, is exactly that they're not doing that. Jaw's no longer the main guy they rely on. The front office has been so disappointed with his inconsistency that they’ve started to shift their focus away from him in recent years. Instead, they’ve built around other stars like Jaren Jackson Jr., who’s an all-star and Defensive Player of the Year candidate. They’ve also added some solid depth with players like homegrown talent Jaylen Wells, Scotty Pippen Jr., and another lottery pick they received from the Bane trade. Cedric Coward is an exciting young rookie and a top pick for them so far. He's really made an impact, and the front office is arguably one of the best around—innovative and sharp. The good news is, they’re no longer stuck relying heavily on Jaw, which is actually bad news for him. If he keeps pulling stunts like this, things aren’t going to look good for his future with the team. That guy's gonna discover the truth, yeah, you're not the same superstar you once were. This isn’t 2022 anymore. Jaw’s not as invincible as he seemed before either. But another young player who might face some issues this year is LaMelo Ball. LaMelo’s been getting a lot of criticism lately, and people haven’t exactly been his biggest fans. There’s still a possibility he might turn things around and prove everyone wrong, but it all comes down to him just tweaking one tiny part of his game.
