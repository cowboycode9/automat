The Thunder kicked off the season pretty well, but there was a bit of an asterisk. They went 10 and 1—nice job, right? Still, if you check out their schedule, it’s filled with games against Dallas, the Clippers, and the Pelicans. Does that mean OKC is really that dominant? Then things got real with back-to-back matchups meant to reveal the truth. First, they faced Golden State one night, then… Next up for the Luca Lakers are the Thunder, and it’s a tough stretch of veteran teams that’s pushing the young squad to their limits. But instead of taking it easy, they went all-out and dragged the Warriors in Los Angeles down a steep slope. It wasn’t just a regular win; they made a statement. JJ Redick was so frustrated after the game that he stormed out of the press conference after losing by 29 points. The Warriors, on the other hand, fell by 24. Draymond Green just What do you think about how all of this played out? He begins pointing out his teammates' personal agendas, which is pretty funny because it makes you think of a team Draymond was part of. The KD Warriors had pretty much cracked the NBA code, to the point where half the league just gave up trying. They’d be like, “Even if we improve a lot, we’re still not beating these guys.” Those guys. So, what’s the point anymore? The thing is, OKC is pretty much one of the most injured teams in the league right now. They’ve got key rotation players out all over the place, including their second-best player, JDub, who’s been out all season. Honestly, if this were most other teams, they’d be in serious trouble. But with OKC… It seems like we’re witnessing the rise of the next major NBA dynasty, with some even calling it the greatest team ever. I’ve really enjoyed playing PrizePicks this season—I’ve had a blast. The schedule’s been getting busier, especially on those nights when there are six, seven, eight, or even more games lined up. It’s been quite the ride. It’s always great to get some picks in and treat every night like it’s playoff time, even during the regular season. What I really love is how simple the app is to use for making those picks. Basically, all you need to do is choose whether you think a few players will go over or under their stats. Tonight, I’m planning to start my lineup with a mix of Tyrese Maxi and James Harden, focusing less on their assists. I’m also going to lean less on Quinton Grimes’ assists. PricePicks is accessible in 45 states, including California and Texas, where I’m based. if it's your first time signing up, nothing helps out the channel more than using code AM hoops. When you play five bucks, that code will get you 50 bucks in lineups instantly, win or lose. That is play five, get 50 code AM hoops. Now, before we get to how they are doing this, the go NBA team really defense is their calling card and OKC is nothing historically. There's like 40 teams better, but the top four there are all from the same year. So, obviously, era's got a lot to do with that. What about compared to this year? OKC is number one by a mile. You do not see gaps that big. They dominate on both ends so bad. They beat teams by an average of 15 1/2 points. That would shatter the previous record 12.9 set by OKC last year. So yeah, they won the title and came back even better. But to be the GOAT team we all know, you have to win at least 73 games beating the 96 Bulls and win the title. something the 2016 Warriors could not do. Well, this Thunder team is on pace for 75 wins. My goodness. Now, I don't think they're actually going to get there because what's the point, right? You hit some random number. 73 wins. Everyone's all excited. Then possibly you run out of gas in the playoffs. No. Rest your guys, which Sam Prey is too smart not to do. But speaking of the Thunder GM, he's got a problem. one that you almost never see in the NBA. Teams are only allowed to carry 15 active players and the Thunder have been losing guys like Vic Kichche. They couldn't keep him. So now he's in Atlanta dropping 28 on the Clippers, Hitting eight threes like it's no big deal. Trey Man leaves, and suddenly he's putting up double digits every night in Charlotte. Josh Giddy, a guy they couldn’t find enough playoff minutes for, just inked a hundred million dollar deal in Chicago. And the wildest part of all this? If the season ended right now, OKC would be… They’ve got two first-round picks in the top 10. What are they planning to do with those young guys? Which players might they have to let go of to make room for them? Probably, they won’t actually end up with two picks in the top 10. I mean, Utah is likely just tanking to hold onto that advantage. Their selection, and the Clippers might decide to act, but snagging a top 10 pick isn’t completely out of the question. That’s actually what turns this situation into a real long-term advantage. In this new era of the second apron, the key to sustaining a dynasty is straightforward: hold onto your stars. Focus on turning over the deep roster and grab low-cost talent before it starts to get pricey. The Thunder are basically engineered for this approach. SJ, Jaylen Williams, and Check are locked in tight. The rest of the team around them keeps getting swapped out for next to nothing. It’s like Sam Presti had a crystal ball and saw how this would all unfold. Building a 10-year dynasty, huh? Look at someone like AJ Mitchell. Last year, he was just a rookie in the G-League on a 2-way deal. Now he's starting because of injuries and putting up around 17 points, four rebounds, four assists, and even grabbing two steals per game. How do they keep finding guys like this? And get this, he's earning three million a year now. It’s wild how fast things can change. It just doesn’t seem fair, right? That’s the strategy they’re using to take over the NBA. But what exactly are they doing? That’s what makes OKC so impressive from the start—especially their defense, despite having zero defensive week links. And by the way, JDub, they haven’t even had him all year, and he’s probably their best and most adaptable defensive player. Now, OKC really focuses on quickness and agility on defense. They play with high energy, constantly closing gaps and squeezing the floor with everyone involved. It’s almost like they’re all in sync, operating as one on that side of the ball. Take this play, for example—when Curry starts to turn the corner off that screen to his left, you can see how all five guys react immediately. OKC defenders bunch up towards the paint, ready to clog it up. When the ball gets kicked out, they bounce back quickly, showing off that speed and agility to get back in their defensive spots. It’s a solid strategy. In the same way, Butler drives straight into the paint, drawing the defense in. OKC collapses on him, squeezing the floor, and then they can easily shift and adjust once the ball moves again. That quickness to bounce back and deliver a powerful punch is what makes this team dangerous. But what really sets them apart is their personnel. First up is Kesan Wallace. Nico Harrison traded him out of Dallas, just so you know. This guy can really hold his own—he’s guarded players like J, Steph, Jimmy—and even managed to hold Luca to just 19 points. He usually hits the court within about a week and comes off the bench for the team. His playing time has been a bit limited up to now, but every time he's out there, you definitely notice his influence. He's got top-notch skills both defensively and offensively, whether he's on or off the ball. Just like Wallace, he's more than capable of holding his own in one-on-one situations. When you look at teams that challenge top-tier scores, it’s often because they focus on consistency rather than flash. That's why a solid team like the Spurs dynasty might seem a little dull to some. They were all about defense and fundamentals, which some people might say is boring. Then there’s the flashy teams, like the ones led by Jordan, Kobe, and Shaq—those are the teams that really get the crowd fired up, with highlight-reel plays and high-octane offense. But ultimately, the game often comes down to that tough, disciplined style, even if it doesn’t always grab the spotlight. It’s really just blue-collar basketball out there. So, SGA has definitely stepped up his game. He might not have quite the same impact as those other two guys before him, but he’s got impressive length, quick foot speed with the ball, and he’s a solid defender. And with all that backcourt and wing depth OKC has built, they also brought in Chad along the way. Isaiah Hardenstein is circling near the basket, showing why he's one of the top rim protectors in the league. But before we dive into their offensive game, we've got to recognize how well Cadet and Hardenstein can switch up defensively. They can guard on the perimeter, making it nearly impossible to find an opening against their defense. That switching ability really keeps opponents on their toes. All of OKC’s weaknesses come from their offense. Looking at this year, I thought they had two main issues: their inconsistent shooting and ball handling. They’re pretty much heavily dependent on their outside shooting. Last season, their player’s usage rate was 33.6 points higher than Jaylen Brunson and Luca Duchic, which is part of why their run to the finals played out the way it did. There were seven games. The Pacers took advantage of that situation, if you recall, by applying full-court pressure to wear him down. That strategy made JDub have to step up and deliver huge performances in games four and five, which ultimately helped them survive. Heading into this season, since OKC was missing that secondary ball handler with JDub out, I thought it would be a real challenge for them. It might not start smoothly, but AJ Mitchell, a second-year G-League two-way player, comes through in the end. OKC isn’t exactly a sharpshooter like Jerchay, but he’s capable of shoulder a lot of the playmaking—handling the ball out of pick-and-rolls, setting the tempo, and breaking down defenses with his dribble. Push the defense back and attack the basket. He's given Sheay some breathing room to move and work within the half-court offense. So when JDub returns, the Thunder will have three skilled ball handlers on the court. My only small concern right now is their three-point shooting. The percentages are still pretty low, landing them in the bottom 10 in the NBA. But even with that, OKC still boasts a top-five offense. So at the moment, the only team with a real shot at beating them is the Denver Nuggets. Nicole Jokic, honestly playing the best basketball of his career, just moved up in the ranks. Just a heads-up, the Thunder are technically first in the MVP race right now, but honestly, we’d still all pick them over anyone else. No matter how strong a team looks, if you’re feeling confident, you probably don’t want to face OKC. On the flip side, the Mavericks are in a different spot; they’re actually looking to take some L’s lately. Now that Nico Harrison is… He's out of sight now, not showing up on his timeline at all. Right now, it’s all about Cooper Flag. So, tank if you want, but more than that, focus on finally getting that Anthony Davis trade right because Cooper Flag’s future really hinges on what they get in return.
