Ryan Rollins was really struggling before he got arrested nearly two years back. His career was hanging by a thread. But now, he’s not only bounced back, he’s actually become a serious contender for most improved player. How do you manage to nearly triple your numbers across the board just when the Bucks needed it most? Kinda like what the Warriors did, right? Ryan was initially drafted but eventually abandoned by the team. Without Giannis there, he steps up and drops a career-high 32 points, sinking that clutch three right in Jimmy Butler's face. How is he pulling this off? It all seems connected to a moment when his career nearly fell apart. Ryan's story starts from... He’s part of a basketball family, but he wasn’t really a top-tier player. Sure, he put up 25 points a game in high school, but he’s only about 6’ or so, not the best shooter, so he didn’t get offers from the major programs. Instead, he ended up at Toledo as a three-star recruit. And if you’ve never heard of Toledo, that’s probably because their last… Back in 1998, there was a basketball player named Casey Shaw. He only played one season in the NBA before heading overseas to Europe. Rollins wasn't initially seen as a likely NBA player, but he quickly proved himself, earning conference freshman of the year and making first team all-conference as a sophomore. By then, he decided to declare for the 2022 NBA draft. Drafted in the second round by Golden State, Ryan somehow went from being an underdog no one really expected to sit next to Steph Curry on the court. It was a moment that could have marked the height of his career. But then, everything changed—Ryan hurt his foot, only managed to play 12 games, and soon after, the Warriors traded him to Washington. And this wasn’t just some normal setback… We’re thinking about that Ryan Rollins deal from DC. It was mostly a throw-in, really. The Warriors ended up with Chris Paul, the Wizards took Jordan P, Patrick Baldwin, Rollins, and two future picks. Basically, it was just a salary dump for the Warriors. But maybe it turned out to be a good fit for Rollins to land with the Wizards. After all, since he was with Golden State, he might have been better off playing somewhere else, and the Wizards could be that place for him now. He was ahead of Steph, Clay, Pool, Moses, Moody, and Tai Jerome. Pretty impressive, right? Then he moves to DC, and after about ten decent appearances, they let him go. What’s the deal? The Wizards drop a 21-year-old who actually looked promising, especially on the defensive end. That’s exactly the type of player teams usually want to nurture.

As of November 2023, Ryan got caught shoplifting from a Target seven separate times. Every time, he’d grab small stuff—things like candles, groceries, body wash. Over those two months he was in Washington, it seems like after going to NBA practices or games, he’d hit up Target to steal something on his own. On his way home, you might wonder, why would he do that? How much was Ryan Rollins earning? It turns out he was making about $1.7 million. He ended up pleading guilty to a misdemeanor, but the Wizards didn’t hold back—they cut him right away. This wasn’t some minor incident like LiAngelo Ball stealing sunglasses in China, you see. It was something different entirely. Hold on a second. Shouldn't we be more empathetic about this? I mean, with 1.7 million involved, it’s clearly a mental health or compulsive problem, not just about money. Yeah, I get that, but the Wizards clearly didn't see him as much of a basketball talent. If they did, they would've taken a different approach. Maybe he should consider therapy or something. You know, NBA teams are willing to put up with a lot when they really believe in a player. But it’s probably a good thing they didn’t, because that kind of wake-up call totally changed the game. Can you even picture getting cut from the worst team in the league? You’ve got to believe in yourself to get through that. The dream has come to an end. Sometimes, a tough dose of reality can hit harder than therapy, but in this case, it wasn’t the end. The Milwaukee Bucks saw potential. He’s not a bad kid, maybe even a decent player. That’s why they decided to give him another shot with a second chance contract. It’s a mix of NBA and G-League time, so… Mess this up and you're finished. But then it occurred—the kind of injury that no one saw coming. Damen Lillard went down late in the game, and suddenly, that injury turned into Ryan Rollins' moment to shine. The Bucks were desperate for someone to step up, and Ryan seized the opportunity. He finished the game shooting 48%. After the All-Star break, he played three games and even got the nod to start in a playoff match. But here's where things get wild. The Achilles tear that ended Dame’s season actually turned Rollins into a multi-millionaire. It all started when Milwaukee initially put forward a $2.6 million qualifying offer—kind of like a trial run. But then… They had to trade him to free up cap space for Miles Turner, which is what made Rollins become a free agent. When the team wanted to bring him back, it ended up costing them a lot more. The Bucks offered Rollins a three-year deal worth $12 million. By NBA standards, that’s not exactly a huge deal. But for a guy who… Getting cut by the Wizards for trying to steal body wash at Target—that's one of those moments that really sticks with you. Like, your life kind of shifts from that point. But nobody was actually sitting around thinking, "Hey, Ryan Rollins could be the solution for Milwaukee." Instead, the buzz was all about trading Giannis this offseason. Not many folks were saying, "Hey, but don’t forget about Ryan Rollins." And then, everything started to change. Maybe he’s just what they’re looking for. In the season opener, Kevin Porter Jr. went down with an injury, so Rollins stepped up and took over. After only scoring 20 points once in his entire NBA career, he put up back-to-back 20-point games in his first week starting. First, he posted a then career-high 25 points on eight of... Eleven shots taken, four assists, four steals on the Knicks. But then Ryan turned things around. He hit a new career-high with 32 points, added eight assists, and only one turnover against Golden State, the team that once gave up on him, and without Giannis. Honestly, nobody expected a Bucks victory, but what happened next definitely caught everyone off guard. So, what’s going on with Ryan Rollins? How’s he managing to make a name for himself? Is his NBA comeback actually happening? It seems like the Bucks have been much better than many of us expected, and a lot of that is because of Giannis. He’s still the dominant force, with the highest usage rate in the league. You see him running a ton of isolations, pick and rolls, just doing his thing on the court. He uses dribble handoffs to help him get closer to the basket, but the game plan is pretty much the same—surround Giannis with shooters. Ryan Rollins fits that role perfectly. He’s knocking down 43.7% of his catch-and-shoot threes, which often come wide open with Giannis drawing all those doubles. But check this out… At that rapid fire moment, this kid really shines. Check out Pascal Siakam right there at the basket. Then he steps up to double-team, and that’s just Ryan Rollins taking a casual practice shot. Still, you’ve got to give him props for sinking it. But his game goes way beyond just those highlights. Over Milwaukee's first nine games, he’s hit about 42% of his off-the-dribble three-pointers. One of his signature moves is that left-hand pound step-back, where he starts out upright and relaxed, as if to say, "No big deal, just messing around." Suddenly, bam. He pulls back smoothly and nails a three right in your face. {"annotations":[],"refusal":null,"role":"assistant"} A whole lot more of Giannis in this play. Yiannis draws two defenders, which leaves Rollins wide open for a straightforward jumper. And since he's become a better shooter, the defenders can't just leave him open—they have to respect his shot. That gives Ryan the chance to make a move and get past his defender. Check out his change of speed here—it's fantastic. But what really stands out is his ability to pass afterward. Ryan’s skill in the pick and roll is pretty remarkable, whether it's those simple lob passes or the slick crosscourt side feeds. He definitely has that true point guard ability down pat. But what could really set him apart is his defense. The wild part is, he doesn’t look like he’s built for it — nothing about his physical frame jumps out — which is what makes his defensive potential even more surprising. He’s always been underestimated. Honestly, he’s just the most frustrating defender in basketball. Never gives his opponent a second to breathe or sneak past him. In fact, he’s top in the NBA for deflections per game, ahead of guys like Dyson Daniels and Oscar Thompson. So yeah, the Bucks are actually pretty impressive this season. This year, Giannis has been on another level, playing like an MVP. Koozma also got benched, and the team is shooting around 40% from three. What really caught us off guard, though, was Ryan Rollins stepping up as a backcourt standout. The kid's super efficient and shows solid defense. All he needed was a shot and a second chance, and he's making the most of it. After nearly losing everything, it’s kind of a heartbreaking story that’s unfolding in Dallas right now. Every day, Mavericks fans are faced with the reminder that Nico Harrison may have mishandled their franchise’s future. But you know who that’s really unfair to? Cooper Flag. Fans can’t even sit back and fully enjoy how talented this kid really is. Maybe someday. So, I had to check if Nico is really going to be let go and whether we should be concerned about Cooper too.
