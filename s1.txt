The Sixers seem like they have everything it takes to reach the NBA finals on paper. They’ve got Joel Embiid, who’s a recent MVP, along with Paul George, a young and talented core, and Tyrese Maxi. Their bench and deeper roster are just as solid, featuring the third overall pick VJ Edgecombe, Kyle Larry, Quinton Grimes who’s on a contract, Jared McCann, and Kelly Ube—all of them making up a very strong top eight. Other teams in the East aren't looking so great this year. The Celtics, Pacers, and Bucks have all taken some hits lately. And the Knicks just let go of Tom Thibodeau, who’s actually been their best coach in quite a while, replacing him with Mike Brown, who’s only managed to win one playoff series in the past 12 years. So, it’s an interesting situation all around. How fired up is Philly right now? Honestly, not at all. Their fans are feeling more down than they have in years. Why's that? Well, they just received some pretty bad news. But first, what's the NBA saying about Philly’s odds? To me, it really highlights how much an NBA team means when you see how many people genuinely care. They only get national TV games now. Philly dropped from 27 games last year to just 14 this season, which is a 13-game decline from the previous year. That’s the biggest downgrade across the whole NBA. No games on Christmas or MLK Day either, and zero spotlight during the first week. The NBA’s basically telling the Sixers, "Hey, you guys, uh, you’re not really a priority anymore." Guys tend to be pretty bad, honestly. We’d rather stay away from them. But then they decided to turn it up a notch. The Sixers just got their new schedule, and man, Philly might have the hardest one in the whole league. They’re facing a league-high 16 back-to-backs, which is a serious challenge. That move really was a game changer for a team dealing with so many injuries. So, what was the point of doing this to Philly? They’re already struggling. Why pile on? Well, the NBA doesn’t make decisions randomly, you know? They’re analyzing something behind the scenes. Maybe it's the same concern that has Philly fans freaking out right now. Because Yeah, the timetable is relentless, but honestly, the real worry isn't what's planned out—it's what's missing from it. Like, will Joel Embiid even be available for opening day? We just got an update that’s flashing some serious red lights. If you’ve been keeping an eye on the Lonzo Ball situation, then you probably know exactly what kind of red flags I’m talking about. This used to make me really nervous, but now that summer's here, I've found my go-to way to stay in shape is by staying active. I like to get some workouts in, but honestly, I focus way more on my diet. Turns out, for me at least, about 90% of maintaining fitness is really down to what I eat. And I... When you're hunting for convenience, a great deal, and most importantly, something that actually tastes good, My Fit Foods really stands out. I’ve been loving them myself.

Don’t forget, the promo code again is AMH25. And speaking of big wins, two years ago, Embiid finally snagged his MVP award, finally surpassing Nicole. Joic averaged 33 points a game, along with 10 rebounds and four assists over 66 games. But 2024 was a different story—he only played in 34 games that season. The main issue was a torn meniscus that needed surgery. Yet, instead of taking it easy that summer, he just couldn’t resist going out there and playing. For Team USA in the Olympics, a year ago, Embiid took home the gold. But unsurprisingly, those knee issues flared up again pretty fast. From day one of training camp, he was dealing with swelling and pain, and he only managed to play 19 games all season. The real issue, though, was that we never got a clear explanation or update on what was going on. Basically, everyone’s left wondering what was really wrong with him. The Sixers didn’t give fans, players, or coaches much insight at all. Nick Nurse, Embiid’s coach, found himself stuck in front of the cameras all season, trying to make excuses. But now, after missing a whole year and having plenty of summer to recover, we finally get a clearer picture. The nurse mentioned that Joel is putting in a ton of effort, and she thinks he's looking pretty solid. But, you know, whether he's fully prepared for training camp or not, I feel like there are probably a lot more factors to consider before we get to that point. What? How can that be? No way, man. He hasn't touched a basketball in ages. So, how is he not prepared? That question makes you consider a couple of other players. Take Kawhi Leonard, for instance. Back in 2017, he dealt with quad tendinitis, which is pretty unusual for an NBA player. The Spurs eventually cleared him to play, but Kawhi was adamant that things just didn’t feel right. Alright, so that whole situation caused a major mess in San Antonio, and they eventually decided to trade him. Since then, Kawhi has been dealing with a string of strange and real injuries. In fact, he’s missed more games than he’s actually played since 2017. The Clippers typically just say it’s knee soreness. That kind of sounds like… I hit my knee on the couch, not “I'm about to destroy my whole career.” That kind of thinking means any squad built around Kawhi now always seems to fall short. The other player we're talking about is Lonzo Ball. Back in 2022, Zo dealt with a minor meniscus tear that was expected to sideline him for about 6 to 8 weeks, but… He never returned. His recovery in Chicago turned into one of the most bizarre stories in recent NBA history. He struggled to walk upstairs and jog without discomfort. The doctors couldn’t figure out why the pain persisted. So, I guess it was another surgery, and after no improvement in 2023, he had a... Zo came back last year after his experimental cartilage transplant, but there are no guarantees about how long he’ll be able to play consistently. Now, here’s the unsettling part: Embiid seems to be following a similar pattern as Lonzo and Kawhi. Mysterious injuries keep cropping up, he’s had multiple surgeries, and nobody really has clear answers. An anonymous NBA medical insider told Clutch Points, "When you have a second surgery…" Trying to fix the original issue and ending up with even more problems? That’s never a good sign. Only a handful of players have managed to come back from multiple surgeries and injuries on the same area, and Joel’s working toward that too. Not ideal. So, yeah. The NBA is well aware of this pattern, and they’re thinking, "We’ve seen this story play out before, and it’s not going to end well." So, Philly, it’s time to say goodbye. Then there’s Paul George, who’s been dealing with multiple injuries last year and hurt himself again during offseason training, which means he needs surgery now. But what if the NBA… What if everyone’s got it wrong? What if they’re counting Philly out when, in reality, they’re the team perfectly suited for this? When they chose VJ Edgecom at number three in the draft this summer, it wasn’t just about picking the most talented player. It was a calculated move. A lot of folks expected them to trade that pick away, but instead, they kept him, signaling a clear plan and confidence in their roster. Getting a seasoned vet might make sense since they're in win-now mode, but that would’ve come at a big cost. The Sixers are already shelling out 55.2 million for Embiid and 51.6 million for PG this season. BJ is still on a rookie scale deal, so he’s pretty affordable right now. But if he performs even near expectations… The idea is that having that huge chunk of value sitting on the floor is what allows Philly to keep around $107 million worth of Embiid and PG while still maintaining a team capable of making the playoffs. If they’d traded that pick for a more experienced veteran instead, the team might be top-heavy, possibly lacking the depth needed to sustain success. So, they’re playing the long game, balancing star power with enough supporting pieces. The Sixers definitely saw this coming all along. Now, the league’s about to find out if their plan really works. But how are they actually going to make it happen? Honestly, the most realistic route probably isn’t snagging the top seed for Philly. My money’s on the Cavaliers having that spot pretty much locked in already. The Knicks might actually be in a good spot. Keep an eye on Orlando as well—they've gotten better with Desmond Bane, but nothing's guaranteed. My feeling is if Embiid and Paul George each play about 50 games, Philly will probably end up as a five or six seed, maybe four if things go right. But mostly, they’ll just sit their veterans a lot to manage their load. So, the plan is to do back-to-back games, take some rest during road trips, and overlap PG and Embiid’s games throughout the season to help them build chemistry and stay healthy. Based on win projections, the East standings have the Cavaliers leading the pack, with New York right behind, and Philly coming in around eighth place. Playing, but there’s definitely a real shot they could jump all the way up to four if they handle things well and surprise everyone—especially those NBA schedule folks who probably didn’t see that coming. The biggest challenge for Philly is really going to be the next four years, with Embiid and Paul George locked in on the roster. In this second apron phase, I can't get over how Philadelphia managed to mess up with Joel Embiid. Like, who else was even in the running to pay him that kind of money? No one else was going to offer him that early, and yet they did. Daryl's supposed to be this genius GM, but honestly, sometimes it seems like he's just making careless moves. That guy really got caught out with those terrible deals. The best shot they have right now is next season since MB and PG aren’t going to be healthier than they are at the moment. All they need to do is control those injuries and then just surprise everyone by exceeding everyone’s expectations. But hey, speaking of the Cavs… Did you catch the hype about Evan Mobley's body makeover? It’s everywhere online. But here’s the thing—they didn’t tell you that the photo is fake. Yep, once again, AI got creative. The real story is that Mobley already had a major transformation last year. He moved from being a top 50 player to cracking the top 15. If he takes off again, don’t even bother mentioning Anthony Edwards or Wimby. The guy’s ceiling is the most underrated story in the NBA right now.
