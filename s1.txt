Mark Stein has a detailed report that hits hard—no one knows Dallas like he does. Since Nico Harrison was let go, nobody has hinted that Anthony Davis might try to push his way out of the Mavericks. It’s widely expected that the team will coordinate with Davis’s representatives as they figure out the next steps. Deciding whether to go after a trade for him or not, that’s the question. But why are the Mavericks dragging their heels on building around Cooper? Are they just plain dumb? Honestly, there’s more to the story here. Think about it: what if another team has come in with an offer? The Mavericks might be saying they want more, but other teams? They’re probably thinking, “No way,” and they’re standing firm. We get it — this whole situation’s more complicated than it looks. You have to offer AD a trade, simple as that. Either you take it or you don't. Dallas needs to make everyone think they might actually keep AD—that’s the only way they can create some leverage. Otherwise, they’re stuck. So don’t buy into those reports; they’re just spinning a story because they have to. The real question is, which team is willing to go all-in for him? A 33-year-old guy who’s always getting hurt, now a little bit chubby—does that even sound legit? Yeah, Texas really does have some killer food. We’ll get into that in a bit. Meanwhile, Nico Harrison’s rivals are now dropping some negative info about him since he left. But hey, we scored again on PrizePicks. Well, technically, we only hit one, but still. The guy sat out, so it was still a bit of a partial win, but that’s now three out of the last five times we’ve actually hit. Keep in mind, I’m not really in this to make money; that’s just a nice bonus for me. The real thing is having my picks on the line—that’s what makes it exciting for me. Playing more really ramps up the excitement, especially on nights when there are a whole bunch of games, like 14 in a row. And what I love most is how simple their app is to navigate. You just select more or less on a handful of players' stats, and your picks are ready to go. My two cents. Here's my lineup for tonight: first, Zack LaVine, focusing on how many free throws he makes. After that, Jimmy Butler, also looking at his free throw makes. Both guys have been hitting a good number of free throws this season. And hey, good luck if you’re betting on my picks. PrizePicks is available in 45 states, including California and Texas, where I’m at. If you put in just five bucks, you’ll instantly get 50 bucks worth of lineups. Win or lose, use the code AM hoops—it's play five, get 50 right away. First, not long after Mark Cuban sold the team, Nico started working behind the scenes to edge Cuban out. Cuban believed he had a say in the decisions, but Nico made sure he stayed out of the loop. By the time he was involved with Luca, Cuban was completely sidelined and couldn’t do anything to block the trade. He had no clue what was really happening. Meanwhile, Coach Jason Kidd started to grow resentful of Cuban, growing impatient with the whole situation. The same situation with Nico and the team’s other officials, especially the ones loyal to the coach, was pretty clear. It was obvious they were at odds with Harrison over the roster moves. The guy couldn't stand that Nico’s only contribution at point guard was bringing in D’Angelo Russell. That’s all he had—nothing else—until Kyrie comes back. By the time game two rolled around, Kid was giving undrafted rookie Ryan Nimhard more playing time than DLo. And that’s not all—players actually wanted Nico out too. They’ve been saying that playing at home became way tougher than on the road. Things got so tense and toxic that even when there was a shot at winning, it felt like the team was more focused on chaos than the game itself. So, about the game the other night, fans were shouting “Fire Nico” while PJ Washington was at the free throw line. Usually, you’d expect silence when your own player’s shooting free throws, not a bunch of noise. But honestly, the biggest thing nobody's really discussing is Klay Thompson. He left the Warriors for a reason, and it feels like that story is quietly lingering in the background. So, he started out as a sixth man, but pretty quickly, he found himself coming off the bench in Dallas even without Luka. He gave up four years and $80 million in LA to join Luka for just $50 million. That’s a $30 million difference in guaranteed money he left on the table because he prioritized winning over the bigger paycheck. The bag’s gone now. But as for the new GM, whoever they might be, owner Patrick Dumont wants someone who’s got a good handle on the media. He’s not a fan of being in the spotlight himself, which you can see in his interviews. So, the team needs a GM who can talk to reporters and fans without a problem. Well, Nico was... It’s just awkward as hell. Even during the good moments, this guy managed to say the wrong thing. It could be Dennis Lindsay, who’s now in Detroit, or Matt Ricardi, the interim GM, but whoever’s in charge is dealing with a complete mess. They really need to overhaul this team around Cooper Flag. So, before we… So, what’s the deal with AD and Kyrie? Moving Kai for future picks and a young guy seems logical on paper, especially since the Mavericks don’t have control over any of their picks until 2031 except for this year. Oh, and speaking of 2029, that’s when Houston’s picks come into play. Can you imagine how big that would be if it all worked out? So, getting your own spot back and Kai fitting well in Houston? Not a traditional point guard, but definitely an upgrade over what the Rockets have right now. If he teams up with his buddy KD, the Mavs could also bring Reed Shepard back. But honestly, fans really love Kyrie. This isn’t just about what’s written on paper—he’s more than that. It’s a bit of a throwback to remember how strong things were back then. Kai and Luca made it all the way to the finals only 16 months ago. Moving on from him would feel like a real blow, especially considering how well they were doing. But if he doesn't come back from the ACL this year, it probably won't impact the decision much. And if… Kai wants to stick around, and he could be a solid fit for Cooper Flag. But he’s definitely not the only player they might consider moving. Honestly, everyone else who’s not named Cooper Flag should be evaluated. They’re definitely off Nico Harrison’s current timeline and seem to be moving into a tanking phase this year. Given all that, the key players are Max Christie, Derek Lively, Daniel Gafford, Clay, Jaden Hardy, and Naji Marshall. The only one who isn’t eligible for treatment yet is PJ Washington. However, no trade is more critical than the one involving Anthony Davis. That move could really jumpstart the rebuild. But honestly, let’s move past the idea of a rebuild for now. The fit just doesn’t add up. Why would you keep a 33-year-old who’s trying to play the same position as an 18-year-old teammate? Plus, it actually benefits the tank. And what happens if AD gets hit with a serious injury? Did you hear that doctors are worried he might tear his Achilles if they push him too hard? Do you think he’ll be able to come back from this injury? Nico was really going all out to get back quickly, the crazy one. If he pushed too hard and it ended up being a disaster, it could ruin everything. So, who would be willing to trade for AD? Keep in mind, just two years ago, Davis played a full 76 games with the Lakers, averaging 25 points and 13 rebounds a night. He was also named to the first team all-defense that season. Second team All-NBA and an All-Star—that’s the kind of player you don't find every day, and one you might be able to snag for a steal. This kind of move could be a once-in-a-lifetime trade opportunity. Sure, AD has his injury issues, but when he’s healthy, he’s the kind of piece that can push a team to a championship. The problem is, Dallas isn’t really in that championship-ready category right now. So, the question is, who’s the right fit? So, what’s got me most hyped right now is the Warriors. Did you see all the chaos in the locker room? After yet another loss, both Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green called out their teammates. I definitely jumped the gun thinking Jonathan Kaminga was really coming into his own—turns out, he’s been pretty inconsistent lately. Bottom line, the Warriors just aren’t looking their best these days. Right now, they’re kind of like a conference finals team. They must be pretty eager to help Steph get that fifth championship. And Anthony Davis might be his best teammate since Kevin Durant. So, what about how they fit together? Well, Golden State is pretty small, and AD’s ability to switch defensively is a perfect match. It’s a great fit overall. And what about… Here's where things get a little complicated. Really complicated, actually. I went over every possibility I could think of, but the fact is, if they want to make the salary work, they’re going to have to part ways with either Jimmy Butler or Draymond Green. It sounds wild, I know, but honestly, there’s no alternative. And now, Jimmy's got more potential to reach greater heights, but there's no denying how vital Draymond Green is to this team and to Steph Curry. Honestly, I don’t think the Warriors would be the same without Draymond. The way he meshes with Steph, helping him play at his best, is just priceless. Because of that, I’d say if the Warriors could land AD or the Bucks, they’d be doing something big. Jimmy Butler goes to the Mavericks, and in return, they land Kyle Kuzma, Bobby Portis, Kevin Porter Jr., Torian Prince, plus control of three first-round picks — which are huge assets. CBS reported this, and I’m really into the idea. Don’t even focus on the players for a second; those three first-rounders are incredibly valuable, especially now that we’re looking past Steph and Giannis. Most people seem to agree. Most probably, Dallas might use those picks in a big trade to boost Cooper. But honestly, I really like the idea of the Bulls making a move. Anthony Davis is from Chicago. The Bulls played pretty solidly even without Kobe White, who’s up for an extension now. There were already rumors about trades before all this. The timing with AD doesn’t line up perfectly, but it’s definitely an interesting option. You know Jerry Rhinor really loves to move tickets. So, the deal on the table has the Bulls getting Anthony Davis, and Maz coming away with Kevin Herder, Kobe White, and a 2029 first-round pick from the Bulls. Ultimately, the best outcome for the Bulls would be landing at least one promising young player along with a solid pick. For Dallas, I’m keeping that on my mind. The other squads I’m watching include the Kings, Wolves, Pacers, Knicks, Hawks, Sixers, Hornets, Pelicans, Raptors, Celtics, and Clippers. It’s quite a list of teams that could possibly want AD, and that could push his trade value even higher. But don’t get your hopes up if Dallas claims they’re not interested. I might stick with him. But I’m not done talking about this Ryan Rollins story. Here’s the thing: this guy stole body wash from Target while earning $1.7 million in the NBA. Not just once or twice, but seven different times. So, I decided to really look into this comeback season he’s having and see what’s going on. What it took for him to finally make his big breakthrough in Milwaukee.
