On paper, the Sixers look like they could confidently make a run to the NBA Finals. [PAUSE] They've got the recent MVP Joel Embiid leading the way, along with Paul George, and some seriously talented young players like Tyrese Maxey. [PAUSE] When you look at their depth, it's pretty stacked—there's Jared McCain, who was the number three pick, Kyle Lowry, Quinton Grimes on a deal, Jared McCain, and Kelly Oubre Jr. [PAUSE] That top eight is deep enough to be competitive with anyone in the league.

As you look at the NBA landscape this season, [PAUSE] it’s clear the East isn’t quite what it used to be. [PAUSE] The Celtics, Pacers, and Bucks have all taken some hits, and things are now kind of up in the air. [PAUSE] Meanwhile, the Knicks just made a surprising move by firing Tom Thibodeau, [PAUSE] arguably their best coach in years, [PAUSE] and replacing him with Mike Brown. [PAUSE] But here’s the thing—Brown’s only won one playoff series in his 12-year career. [PAUSE] So, yeah… things are definitely interesting over there.

How fired up is Philly right now? [PAUSE] Honestly, not very. Their fans seem more downbeat than they’ve been in ages. [PAUSE] And why's that? Well, they just received some really bad news. [PAUSE] But first, let’s see what the NBA itself thinks about Philly’s prospects. [PAUSE] It really highlights how much an NBA team can mean when you look at the number of…

So, check this out [PAUSE]. Philly’s all the way down from 27 national TV games last year to just 14 this time around [PAUSE]. That’s a 13-game drop, and honestly, it’s the biggest downgrade across the entire NBA [PAUSE]. No games on Christmas or MLK Day either—zero spotlight during the first week [PAUSE]. Looks like the NBA’s basically saying, “Yo, Sixers, uh, you guys…”

Guys are gonna struggle out there [PAUSE]… we’re not interested in teaming up with them. [PAUSE] But then, they had to turn up the heat. [PAUSE] The Sixers just got their new schedule, and let me tell you, Philly might have one of the hardest ones in the whole league. [PAUSE] They’ve got a league-high 16 back-to-backs, which is a...

They’re a real threat for a team struggling with injuries. [PAUSE] So, why did they do this to Philly? I mean, Philly’s already hurting. [PAUSE] Why add more pain? But honestly, the NBA doesn’t just throw darts in the dark, you know? [PAUSE] They’re seeing something, maybe the same stuff Philly fans are losing sleep over. Because…

Yeah, the schedule's tough, no doubt about it [PAUSE], but honestly, the real concern isn’t just the games we see coming up [PAUSE], it’s the stuff that’s not listed on the calendar. Like, will Joel Embiid even be ready for opening night? [PAUSE] We just got some news, and it’s not looking great—huge red flags, honestly. [PAUSE] If you followed what happened with Lonzo Ball, you know how some injuries can suddenly derail everything without warning.

That tends to make you pretty nervous, doesn’t it? [PAUSE] But hey, summer’s finally here, and my go-to way to stay in shape is to get some workouts in. [PAUSE] But honestly, I’ve learned that the real game-changer is what you eat. [PAUSE] For me, I’d say about 90% of maintaining my shape is all about dialing in my diet. [PAUSE] It’s crazy how much that makes a difference, whether I’m talking NBA players like Tyrese Maxey or Jared McCain, or just staying sharp myself.

Looking for convenience, a great price, and something that actually tastes good [PAUSE]? My Fit Foods has been a game-changer for me [PAUSE]. A lot of you have reached out and told me you love them too [PAUSE]. They offer pre-made meals that you can have ready in just a few minutes [PAUSE], making it super easy to stay on track without sacrificing flavor.

They really offer a crazy variety, so I never find myself getting bored [PAUSE]. And hey, if you do decide to check them out, it helps the channel—just use my code AMH25 for 25% off your first order [PAUSE]. They've got locations all across Texas [PAUSE], and you might even stroll into a store in Portland or Denver someday.

More spots will be opening up soon. [PAUSE] But honestly, I’ve tried so many meal prep places over the years. [PAUSE] My Fit Foods, though, is hands down the best I’ve ever experienced. [PAUSE] So, definitely give them a look. [PAUSE] And don’t forget, the discount code is AMH25. [PAUSE] Oh, and about two years ago, Embiid finally took home that MVP trophy, beating out Nikola Jokic.

Joic was averaging a solid 33 points a game, along with 10 rebounds and four assists over 66 contests [PAUSE]. But in 2024, he took a noticeable dip, only hitting the court in 34 games [PAUSE]. The main issue was a torn meniscus that needed surgery [PAUSE]. But instead of easing up that summer, this guy just couldn't stay away from the game [PAUSE].

So, about a year back, we watched Embiid snag that gold for Team USA in the Olympics. [PAUSE] But, surprise, surprise—those knee problems flared right up again. [PAUSE] Swelling and pain had him sidelined from day one of training camp, and he only managed to play 19 games all season. [PAUSE] But here’s the thing—we never really got a clear explanation from him or the team about what’s going on.

So, here’s the deal with what was really going on [PAUSE] with Joel Embiid. Basically, he was dealing with some issues that weren’t made totally clear. The Sixers didn’t exactly keep the fans, players, or coaches in the loop [PAUSE], which left a lot of questions hanging. Then, there was Nick Nurse, Embiid's coach [PAUSE], just out there in front of cameras all year, trying to make excuses and explain what was happening. But now, after missing an entire season and having the summer to rehab [PAUSE], it seems like things might be looking up.

The nurse mentioned this [PAUSE]. I know Joel's been putting in a ton of work, and honestly, things seem promising [PAUSE]. But whether he's actually ready for training camp or not, I feel like there are a bunch of other factors to consider before we jump to that point [PAUSE]. What? How is that even possible? Dude.

He hasn't touched a basketball in ages, so how is he not prepared? [PAUSE] That question kind of makes you think of a couple other players. Take Kawhi Leonard, for example. Back in 2017, he was dealing with quad tendinitis—a pretty odd injury for an NBA guy. [PAUSE] The Spurs finally cleared him, but Kawhi kept saying that things just didn’t feel right.

Right [PAUSE], this sparked a major stir in San Antonio, and they ended up trading him. Since then, Kawhi has been dealing with a string of mysterious, yet legit injuries. Honestly, since 2017, he's missed more games than he's actually played. The Clippers usually label it as knee soreness [PAUSE], but that kind of sounds like...

I knocked my knee on the couch just now [PAUSE] and now I feel like I’m about to wreck my whole career. [PAUSE] So basically, any team that's centered around Kawhi Leonard [PAUSE] never seems to quite get over the hump. [PAUSE] And then there’s Lonzo Ball. [PAUSE] Back in 2022, Lonzo had a minor meniscus tear [PAUSE] and they expected him to be out for about 6 to 8 weeks. [PAUSE] But of course… things don’t always go as planned.

He never returned, you know. [PAUSE] His recovery in Chicago turned out to be one of the weirdest stories in recent NBA history. [PAUSE] He was struggling to walk upstairs and even jog. [PAUSE] Doctors were stumped—no clue why he was still feeling pain. [PAUSE] So, another surgery, I suppose. [PAUSE] And after making no real progress in 2023, he had a...

An experimental cartilage transplant [PAUSE] Zo eventually made his way back last year, but there's no real certainty about how he'll perform in the long run [PAUSE]. And now, here's the concerning part [PAUSE]. Joel Embiid seems to be following the same risky path as Lonzo Ball and Kawhi Leonard [PAUSE]. Mysterious injuries, multiple surgeries, and no clear answers [PAUSE]. According to an NBA medical insider who spoke with Clutch Points [PAUSE], "When you have a second surgery…"

To try to fix the original issue and then end up with more problems… [PAUSE] that’s never a good sign. [PAUSE] Only a handful of guys have managed to bounce back from multiple surgeries and injuries on the same area, and Joel is hoping to do just that. [PAUSE] Not a great look, honestly. [PAUSE] So, yeah.

You know the NBA’s watching this and thinking, [PAUSE] “Yeah, we've seen this story play out already, and it doesn’t look promising.” So, Philly, [PAUSE] it’s time to say goodbye. Meanwhile, Paul George is dealing with injuries again, [PAUSE] multiple setbacks last year, and now he’s hurt once more during offseason training. [PAUSE] He’s even gotta go under the knife. But what if the NBA…

Is it possible they’re ignoring Philly’s potential here? [PAUSE] I mean, maybe they’re counting them out, but honestly, Philly’s lineup is perfectly built for this kind of environment. [PAUSE] Remember when they drafted Jared McCain at number three this summer? [PAUSE] It wasn’t just because of his skills — it was a strategic move. [PAUSE] A lot of folks thought they’d trade that pick, but instead, they went with Edgecom, and that tells you a lot about their game plan.

To bring in a seasoned veteran because they're in win-now mode, but yeah, that would've cost a lot [PAUSE]. The Sixers are already shelling out 55.2 million for Embiid and 51.6 million for James Harden this coming season [PAUSE]. BJ is still on a rookie scale deal, so he's pretty affordable [PAUSE]. But if he can put up even close to that level…

Here’s a more conversational, natural version with pauses for TTS:

So, the expectation is massive value on the floor [PAUSE], you know? That’s how Philly can justify having a $107 million Embiid and PG sitting on the bench [PAUSE], while still keeping a team that’s playoff-ready [PAUSE]. But if they’d swapped that pick for another veteran, they’d be way too top-heavy [PAUSE], and probably out of depth [PAUSE]. So…

Yeah, the Sixers had this in mind all along [PAUSE], and now the rest of the league is about to see if their game plan actually pans out [PAUSE]. So, how do they intend to make it happen? Well, honestly, aiming for that number one seed isn’t really in the cards [PAUSE]. I’d say the Cavaliers pretty much have that spot on lock [PAUSE].

Alright, so maybe the Knicks are in the mix there. [PAUSE] And you’ve gotta keep an eye on Orlando too— they've boosted their squad with Desmond Bane, but it’s not a certainty. [PAUSE] If Embiid and Paul George each manage around 50 games, then Philly probably lands as a five or six seed, maybe a four if things go right. [PAUSE] But honestly, they tend to sit the vets quite a bit during the season.

So, here’s the plan [PAUSE] — they’re spacing out those single back-to-backs, giving players rest during road trips, and stacking PG and Embiid’s games later in the season [PAUSE] to help them build better chemistry and stay healthy. Based on win totals, the projected East standings have the Cavs at the top [PAUSE], then New York right behind them, and Philly hanging around the eighth spot [PAUSE] in the rankings.

They're in the mix, no doubt [PAUSE], but there's a real shot they could climb all the way to conference top four if everything falls into place [PAUSE]. They just need to outperform expectations and maybe even surprise those NBA schedule planners a bit. [PAUSE] The biggest challenge for Philly, though, might be the upcoming four years with Embiid and Paul George locked in on their rosters [PAUSE].

A Max. [PAUSE] In the second apron era, I find it wild that Philly ended up making those missteps. [PAUSE] Honestly, who were they even competing with to keep Joel Embiid? [PAUSE] Nobody else was going to offer him that kind of deal, and yet they jumped in early. [PAUSE] Daryl, I thought he was supposed to be this genius GM. [PAUSE] Well,

That dude got exposed with those terrible contracts, huh? [PAUSE] Honestly, the best shot they’ve got is next season, because MB and PG? [PAUSE] They’re not really getting any healthier than they are now. [PAUSE] All they’ve gotta do is manage those injuries and just surprise everyone by exceeding expectations. [PAUSE] But speaking of the Cavs,

Did you catch this Evan Mobley body transformation? [PAUSE] It’s been all over the internet lately. [PAUSE] But here’s the thing—what they didn’t mention is that the photo is totally fake. [PAUSE] Yep, AI striked again. [PAUSE] But Mobley has already made a real transformation. [PAUSE] Last year, he went from being a top 50 player to cracking the top 15. [PAUSE]

If he takes another jump, don’t even worry about Anthony Edwards or Wemby anymore. [PAUSE] That guy’s ceiling is seriously the most underrated storyline in the NBA right now. [PAUSE] His potential could redefine how we look at young stars.
