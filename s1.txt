Warriors have that date circled, folks. January 15th marks the first day Jonathan Kuminga can be traded. And if anyone says he won't be dealt, they're mistaken. There’s a ton of toxic bad blood between Golden State and their 2021 first round pick. It's nearly finished, but not quite yet. So, Kaminga signed a 2-year, $ 48.5 million deal with a team option at the end. He wanted a player option for leverage, but that was denied. Why did he end up surrendering? Because his other path was the qualifying offer at only 8 million bucks, but it ultimately turned Not down 50 million guaranteed just to secure that option on the table. No. But Kaminga finally blinked, meaning this is as tradable a deal as he could possibly sign. If a team wants him merely to shed payroll, they could move for JK and drop him anyway. Or if People like how he plays, they could exercise the option and stall his timeline. But which teams will truly be interested in him? Quite a few, because Jonathan Gomega has demonstrated standout role-player traits, maybe even more in 2024, for instance he put up 19 points per game that season. five rebounds and three assists in the last 44 games of the season, a stat line comparable to Desmond Bane, Bridges, or Andrew Wiggins in the year the Warriors won the title, so why not keep JK, he's 23 years old, because so far it's been a nightmare they drafted Kaminga went seventh overall in 2021, hoping he would be the next athletic wing to push the Warriors forward. At 6'8, honestly, explosive, he could finish at the rim and looked like a two-way star. But the issue showed up fast. They passed on Fron Vagner, who would’ve been perfect. Not the kind of player who fits the Golden State approach. JK is an ISO scorer, though they already have their primary option with Steph Curry. Defensively, Kuminga has the tools to guard anyone, but the Warriors require flawless rotations and discipline, which Kuminga lacks. Oh, and the shooting overall. not steady. So, defenses back off, clogging the lane for everyone else. So, Kerr sat him for vets, especially in the playoffs, which started to piss him off. Now, at first, you could kind of explain it, right? Like, well, he's 20 years old. We're trying to win a title. championship here. Yet last season, this was Kaminga's fourth year. Kerr sat him in the key matchups. It was only after Steph was sidelined that he had to put Kaminga in. He exploded for 21 points, hitting 54% against the Wolves in round two. But if things had gone differently. he's that good, why did he see so little court time? Because Warriors traded for Jimmy Butler. In fact, Steve Kerr admitted as much. Yep. Jimmy's arrival trimmed many of Jonathan's minutes. as soon as Jimmy showed up and we started winning. Jonathan was benched for the entire stretch. We Go 17 and three or something. So, we'll keep rolling with what's been working. But a lineup of Jimmy, Jonathan, and Draymond doesn't fit very well. Honestly, we need more spacing. And if those are the three guys, Jimmy, Draymond, Kaminga, who do you think's probably going to be the Odd man out, right? Picture Kuminga in that instant. Kerr benches him with four DNP CDs during the postseason. Yet as soon as he puts him in, Duke erupts, posting 20-plus a game in the playoffs. He must have been furious. Like, I told you I’m good, for real. Get Hard to walk away from the spotlight, right? But very few teams had cap space this off season. So, when nobody stepped forward with an offer, JK remained tied to the Warriors. But hey, we’re here. It all fell into place. So, what comes next? Well, Kaminga must earn Steve Kerr’s trust again aims to show another team that he’s worth a trade. In reality, the Warriors quietly need Kuminga right now because he’s 23, and the potential dub starting five would be aging quickly. An average age of 36. Frankly given everything, I think this is the absolute best Meme to illustrate it. Steph squeezed two timelines into a single, very old one. And yes, Brandon Pazki could cut that figure, but we’ll see. Now, aging brings wisdom and success, yet with injuries, you’d expect Jimmy Butler to be sidelined, in the near term, and raise serious concerns for like a couple of weeks here, a couple there, and that'll be Kuminga's moment to shine. Now, before we assess how strong the Warriors can be this season, they're incomplete. Okay, we won't truly know who they are until after this trade. So, what direction is it taking? Now, the The Warriors will initially claim they intend to keep Kaminga and see what unfolds. But that's not true. It's the same line they used about D'Angelo Russell years ago. They swore they wouldn't trade him the moment Andrew Wiggins became available. Fans waited, wondering if reality would ever match up. They got him. So at 22.5 million, the Warriors now have a lineup of players they could swap Kaminga for straight up. That list features Dillon Brooks, Contavious Caldwell-Pope, and Andrew Nembhard would fit well, especially given the Pacers' current issues. They could also target more options with cap space. Herb Jones could matter if the Pelicans simply crater Derek White and Anthony Simons. Right now, you dislike Dylan Brooks, yet he played solid 3 and D in Houston, contributing to their wins. Anthony Simons might actually win them regular-season games, fitting the system to keep the veterans fresh for the playoffs. The dream target remains Derek White. He checks nearly every box. A defender who can switch. All defense back-to-back years to the last three. A guard who thrives without the ball. Catch-and-shoot threat. Ultra low-maintenance and an outstanding glue/locker-room guy. Team USA brought him along to the roster. Paris to take gold. Cost poses the only real hurdle today. Okay, the Celtics hold multiple picks, at least for White, but the Warriors want to keep theirs for someone else. And I know this sounds wild, but Giannis will influence everything the Warriors do. Thus they have options ahead. Serious plans to reel Giannis in if he bolts from Milwaukee. And we just watched at Bucks media day Giannis blast the Bucks’ new owner for claiming he wants to be a lifer. Yes, it’s a long shot, but absolutely a real thing, some big talk brewing, So, just for fun, what could the Dubs swap for the Greek Free if things crumble in Milwaukee? Their absolute best offer would be Giannis for Jonathan Aminga, Brand Pazki, Moses Moody, Buddy Heield. Three first round picks on three swaps. That is every single pick the Dubs possess, for sure. Still not enough. The only route for Golden State to outbid a club like Rockets hinges on Yiannis declaring he wants to be a Warrior exclusively. He has a one team wish list, so anticipate JK being traded for someone a little less freaky. But when that occurs, and then maybe soon. How strong can the Warriors be this season? We all want to see Steph Curry push deep into the playoffs. OKC is the West favorite, followed by the Nuggets, Lakers, Rockets, Clippers, Wolves, then Warriors. It feels crazy for Golden State to sit only above the Mavs at all and the Spurs. For example, I’d say the Al Horford signing is seriously underrated. Al is the stretch center Golden State needs. It’s tough with Jimmy and Draymond not reliable three-point shooters. So Horford strengthens that rotation. And despite his age, Al earned trust in Boston during his time with them. Final word: he can dish it as well. He plays almost like a second Draymond on the floor, giving you that kind of all-around game the entire matchup. Bottom line: Alford may be older, but he rises for the big moments—something you definitely don’t want to miss, ever in playoffs. Rely on him Tuesday in Charlotte, yet against Nicole Joic in the playoffs, he’ll turn back the clock. So yes, the Dubs are far better than expected, but they could improve further with the right JK Tree, right now. There may be an outside shot that he somehow matures, fits. Into the dub system, stays. Either way, this thread outlines the arc that will decide the dynasty's fate. Vibes are strong in Golden State at the moment, at present. Not so in Philly, where the Sixers just wrapped media day and, sadly, might be the most downbeat squad in the in the NBA at present
