Giannis seems clueless about his plan. At media day just before the season, the Bucks owner said he talked with Giannis, who remains loyal to the team, and Giannis replied, "I have no idea what he's talking about." Seriously, Giannis? Just before the season, that's when you'd offer something surprising. you're not devoted. Sort of the worst moment to do that. And imagine all the pressure on the Bucks now since ESPN reports Giannis and his agent are weighing teams that could actually land him by the deadline this year. What? Imagine if they begin 2 and 8 like that. Did last season. The whole thing could spiral, but weâ€™ll touch on those realistic teams shortly. First, Giannis has been playing this coy for years. Now, Sham reports not only that he considered a trade this summer, but that his preferred destination is the New York Knicks for this season. Shams also notes that the Bucks and Knicks talked about a deal, but it never gained momentum. Now, Fionis does want out. Suppose the Bucksâ€™ season goes south, hypothetically, then he has a date by which he must tell the Bucks he wants a trade. And if he doesn't, this has got to be the most irritating drawn out fiasco in NBA history. Oh, but when is that date? Well, letâ€™s say the Bucks face a narrow window to persuade him to really stay loyal. Yet the Knicks must feel equally annoyed since they already decided to take their shot their shot. New York surrendered seven first round picks and two solid players, Julius Randle and Dante DiVincenzo, in exchange for Karl-Anthony Towns and Mikal Bridges. And yes, the move propelled them to East Finals for the first time in 25 years, and could still establish them as a frontrunner. finals since 1999, yet that drastically curtails their chance to land Giannis. Picture this: imagine your lifelong crush waits to ask you out only after you tie the knot. Seriously? Now, Iâ€™ve just returned from my honeymoon, but I am still figuring out what comes next in this crowded game. Thrilled to have NBA basketball back in Houston with us.

And so now a two team trade is Clunky situation, since the Knicks are out of draft options. They need to move veterans, but Milwaukee isnâ€™t craving vets. They want a rebuild. Itâ€™s like they donâ€™t own a pick until 2031. Millions in dead money from the Damian Lillard deal. Now the Knicks could trade their 2031 picks. and 2033 is due this coming summer. But what this implies is they must now arrange a three-team deal to send directly the Bucks these picks and young players in return for their vets. But thatâ€™s where it heats up. Thatâ€™s where the Knicks say, "Well, we love Giannis, but" Make this passage entirely your own while preserving its sense and the same number of words. Keep it easygoing and readable. Retain every name, fact, and detail exactly as given. Donâ€™t insert pauses or special formatting: thatâ€™s off-limits. Now, ask yourself which Knicks veterans might have to move. The roster reportedly includes Carl Anthony Towns, Ojan Nobi, Mikuel Bridges, and Jaylen Brunson. Itâ€™s clear the Bucks will target the king of New York. Brunson is the lone veteran on a team that still has room for improvement and surprises ahead. cost-effective move. A standout asset in the regular season and postseason. Could drive a multi-team swap that returns all the Bucks' picks back for a rebuild. Perfect. The catch is Brunson is family by blood. His father stays on coaching staff. His seasoned godfather, longtime mentor, to several franchises, Leon Rose runs the front office. So asking for Brunson from them is basically like asking for their own son. But would they do it? If not, Giannis waited too long to push for a trade. Because the Knicks lack anything close to a competitive package when you look at it. Other teams. The only fix left is for Giannis to turn it ugly. I mean make every Milwaukee Buck supporter who adores you start disliking you instead. How could he pull that off? That's known as the Anthony Davis path. When AD departed New Orleans, the Celtics actually possessed power. the top bid seemed solid, but AD stated he'd only re-sign with the Lakers, so Boston would be fools to present that deal since they're just renting him for a year. Which forced the Pels to settle for a worse option on the table. fans booing AD on his way Even while watching him grow up in their city on their team. And the sole reason AD could actually pull that off was that his contract was in its final year exactly. So Giannis would have to decide next off-season, since by then he would have one year still left. year left. Either he can re-sign an extension to remain with the Bucks or push for a trade. That sets the deadline. And Iâ€™m afraid he isnâ€™t going to extend in Milwaukee, of course. Clearly, for years heâ€™s stirred chatter because he wants to win. Otherwise, he would just be Loyal to the Bucks through thick and thin. But no, his loyalty is conditional. And even with the Celtics and Pacers banged up, the Bucks have worse odds than the Piston Celtics and Sixers to win the East, about to be a disaster. I mean, they deal for Miles Turner as a last-ditch gambit. It won't shift the tide. So, if Giannis stirs things up, New York could become a possibility. But Giannis won't go there, right? It's not in his nature. So, which other franchises might reel in the Greek Freak? In fact, a few big contenders are plausible. realistic. That's because clubs have saved cap room for this moment. The cap space holders now include the Lakers, Clippers, Warriors, Rockets, Heat, and Nets, among others. All of them could sign Giannis outright in summer of 2027. But what about a possible trade? Look, with AD's situation, the Lakers they could have signed him in free agency, but they wanted him immediately. So the obvious trade contenders are the Rockets, Spurs, Lakers, and Thunder. We can rule out OKC for clear reasons. They're doing okay, but the Lakers are in play here, as well. All right, beginning next summer, they have three tradable first round picks, multiple swaps, and Austin Reeves in the signing trade, but the point is Luca Donuch stars, especially from Europe, and would love to play with Luca in LA. And think about the major star moves, okay? They don't just go anywhere. They go to team up. Kawawaii joined the Clippers only if Paul George was there. 82 LA for LeBron. Kevin Durant with Steph. LeBron switched teams for Dwayne Wade then Kyrie. So, yeah, Luca Giannis next year is quite realistic, which explains why the Lakers have been willing to piss off LeBron So bad he might retire. But if it becomes an allout bidding war for Giannis, the Rockets present the strongest offer by a mile. Their centerpiece is Amen Thompson, a 23-year-old potential star whose stock could rise even faster with ball duties without Fred Van Vleet. Talks resume later today. Rockets also hold other people's picks. See, if Giannis makes it to their squad, the Bucks won't want the Rockets' picks. They'd land in the first round. But other people's picks. Houston can offer a net swap in 27, a Suns unprotected 27 first, a Suns swap in 29, plus they hold Rockets' picks in 31 and 33. No doubt Houston has the best package. But in the tier below is the Spurs because they landed De'Aaron Fox for cheap. They still have picks to trade. And like the Lakers, the Spurs have a potential top three guy as a --- **Support Pollinations.AI:** ðŸŒ¸ **Ad** ðŸŒ¸ Get game-changing insights with Pollinations.AI â€” [Support our mission](https://pollinations.ai/redirect/kofi) to keep elite analysis free for fans like you. Co-starring alongside Victor Wembanyama. Spursâ€™ package centers on Dylan Harper, this No. 2 pick from last yearâ€™s draft. A 2026 swap with Atlanta, an unprotected 2027 Hawks first, a 28 swap with Boston, a 2030 swap with Dallas or Minnesota, a 31 swap with the Kings and their own 32. first round pick. So, sure, the Rockets offer the strongest package, but the Spurs have the standout star. Yet if Giannis truly wanted New York, he should have spoken up before their major moves. That's what makes this fresh Sean report so puzzling. Because now this saga just keeps dragging. Yet we do have a deadline, at least. If the guy doesn't extend in Milwaukee next summer, we'll finally figure out what Giannis is actually planning to do. But there's one more trade we might see before Giannis. Two credible reports say Lauri Markkanen is the next star who's going to be dealt to in the NBA. And both of those reports name the same team to land him. Still, I was surprised that two other teams werenâ€™t mentioned, because theyâ€™re even more plausible.
