On paper, the Sixers could easily make the NBA finals. They have recent MVP Joel Embiid, Paul George, Elite Youth, and Dyres Maxi. It's serious depth like number three pick VJ Edgecom, Kyle Larry, Quinton Grimes with a contract, Jared McCann, and Kelly Ubé as good of a top eight as you will find on paper. Other teams are terrible. This year, the East has seen the Celtics, Pacers, and Bucks all take hits. And the Knicks just fired Tom Tibido, best coach they've had in years for Mike Brown, who's won a single playoff series in 12 years. So, how excited is Philly? Not at all. Their fan base is more hopeless than they have been in years. Why? Well, they did just get some terrible news. But first, what does the NBA think of Philly's chances? Well, nothing shows how important an NBA team is as how many national TV games they get. And Philly went from 27 last year to 14. That is a 13game difference from last season. The biggest downgrade in the entire NBA. No games on Christmas or MLK day. Ze...

[PAUSE] Honestly, the Sixers look like they could make the NBA finals on paper. They’ve got MVP Joel Embiid, Paul George, and some serious young talent like Dyres Maxi. [PAUSE] Plus, solid depth with VJ Edgecom, Kyle Larry, Quinton Grimes, Jared McCann, and Kelly Ubé—[PAUSE] that’s a strong top eight.

You’ll see this on paper, but honestly, other teams are struggling. [PAUSE] The East’s been hit hard this year—Celtics, Pacers, Bucks all taking hits. [PAUSE] And the Knicks just let go of Tom Thibodeau, their best coach in ages, for Mike Brown, who’s only won one playoff series in 12 years. So, [PAUSE]

How fired up is Philly? [PAUSE] Honestly, not at all. Their fans are feeling more hopeless than they have in years. [PAUSE] Why? Because they just received some really bad news. [PAUSE] But first, let’s see what the NBA thinks of Philly’s odds. [PAUSE] The importance of an NBA team is really proved by how many…

So, the Sixers got fewer national TV games this year. [PAUSE] Last year, they had 27, and now it’s down to 14—[PAUSE] a drop of 13 games from last season. [PAUSE] Basically the biggest step back in the NBA. [PAUSE] No games on Christmas or MLK Day, [PAUSE] zero spotlight early on. [PAUSE] It’s almost like the NBA’s telling Philly, "Yo, Sixers, uh… you… [PAUSE]"

Guys can be pretty disappointing, honestly. We just want to steer clear. [PAUSE] But then, things got real intense. The Sixers just saw their new schedule, and it’s brutal—probably the toughest in the league. They’ve got 16 back-to-backs, a total nightmare. [PAUSE] It’s going to be a rough ride.

This move was rough for a team already battling injuries [PAUSE] So, why’d they do that to Philly? They’re already struggling, and now they’re adding more weight to their shoulders [PAUSE] The NBA doesn’t just throw things out there without reasons, you know? They’re probably seeing something we’re all worried about too [PAUSE]

Yeah, the timetable is tough, but the real worry isn’t what's planned [PAUSE], it’s what isn’t. Like, will Joel Embiid even be ready for opening day? [PAUSE] We just received an update with some serious red flags. If you kept up with Lonzo Ball’s situation, you’ll understand what I mean.

This probably makes you pretty nervous, huh? [PAUSE] But summer’s here, and my go-to way to stay in shape is just a bit of exercise. [PAUSE] Honestly, I’ve learned that about 90% of it comes down to diet. [PAUSE] That’s what works best for me.

[PAUSE] I'm all about finding something convenient, affordable, and downright tasty. My Fit Foods really hit the mark for me. [PAUSE] Many of you have told me you love them too. [PAUSE] They’re pre-made meals that take just a few minutes to heat up and enjoy.

They offer such a wide range, I never find myself bored. [PAUSE] And honestly, it helps the channel if you check them out and use my code AMH25 for 25% off your first order. [PAUSE] They have shops across Texas, and you can even find them in Portland or Denver.

More shops on the way, but I’ve tried tons of meal prep spots—[PAUSE] and honestly, My Fit Foods stands out as the absolute best. [PAUSE] Definitely give them a look. [PAUSE] Oh, and the discount code again is AMH25. [PAUSE] By the way, two years ago, Embiid finally snagged the MVP over Nicole.

Joic averaged 33 points, 10 rebounds, and four assists over 66 games, [PAUSE] but in 2024, he only played 34 games. [PAUSE] Turns out, a torn meniscus that needed surgery slowed him down. [PAUSE] Still, he refused to sit out that summer—just had to keep playing.

For Team USA at the Olympics, a year back, Embiid snagged gold. [PAUSE] But surprise—his knee problems flared up again fast. Swelling and pain hit from day one in training camp, and he played only 19 games all year. [PAUSE] The tricky part? We never quite got a solid explanation.

Here’s a fresh take: [PAUSE] Everyone was left in the dark about what really was wrong with Embiid. The Sixers, fans, players, coaches—all kept in the loop. [PAUSE] Coach Nick Nurse was stuck giving vague excuses in front of cameras all year. [PAUSE] Now, after missing a whole season and summer of rehab, [PAUSE] we finally get some clarity.

The nurse mentioned this. [PAUSE] I know Joel's really grinding, and I think he's in a good spot, but honestly, whether he's ready for training camp isn't the only thing we need to consider. [PAUSE] There might be way more decisions to make before we even get to that point. [PAUSE] What? How's that even possible? Dude.

He hasn't touched a basketball in ages, so how is he not prepared? [PAUSE] It makes you wonder about two other guys, like Kawhi Leonard. Back in 2017, Kawhi dealt with quad tendinitis—an odd injury for an NBA star. The Spurs cleared him, but Kawhi said it still didn’t feel right. [PAUSE]

Right [PAUSE], so that caused a big mess in San Antonio, and they ended up trading him. Kawhi’s had a string of strange yet legit injuries since then. Honestly, he’s missed more games than he’s played since 2017, and the Clippers just call it knee soreness. That sound about right [PAUSE]?

So, I smacked my knee on the couch, and now I feel like I'm gonna ruin my whole career [PAUSE]. Basically, any team centered around Kawhi now just falls short [PAUSE]. Oh, and speaking of players, there’s Lonzo Ball—back in 2022, he had a minor meniscus tear, expected to sideline him for 6 to 8 weeks [PAUSE].

He never returned. [PAUSE] His recovery in Chicago turned into one of the wildest stories in recent NBA history. [PAUSE] He struggled with walking stairs and jogging. Doctors were stumped—no clue why the pain persisted. [PAUSE] So, another surgery, and after no real progress in 2023, he...[PAUSE]

[PAUSE] Zo finally made it back last year after an experimental cartilage transplant, but no one can promise he'll stay healthy long-term. [PAUSE] What’s really worrying is that Embiid seems to be zigging where others like Lonzo and Kawhi have zagged—facing strange injuries and multiple surgeries. [PAUSE] An NBA insider told Clutch Points, "When you have a second surgery…"

Trying to fix the original issue often leads to more complications, [PAUSE] which isn't reassuring. [PAUSE] Very few athletes manage to bounce back after multiple surgeries and injuries to the same area—[PAUSE] and that's exactly what Joel’s shooting for. [PAUSE] Not looking great, honestly.

The NBA’s like, [PAUSE] “Been here, done that, not gonna end good.” So, Philly’s out. Then Paul George, [PAUSE] he’s hurt again—multiple problems last year, tweaks himself in the off-season, and now he needs surgery. But, [PAUSE] what if the NBA...

What if people are overlooking Philly, thinking they’re wrong? [PAUSE] Actually, they’re the team built for this moment. [PAUSE] When they drafted VJ Edgecom at number three this summer, it was more than just talent—it was about strategy. [PAUSE] Many believed they’d trade that pick, but they kept it.

You might want to get a solid vet in—[PAUSE] someone who's in win-now mode, but that usually costs a lot. The Sixers already have Embiid at 55.2 million and PG at 51.6 million next season. BJ’s on a rookie deal, [PAUSE] so he’s cheap. [PAUSE] But if he performs even close to…

[PAUSE] The key is the huge value in the roster, [PAUSE] which is how Philly manages to keep $107 million of Embiid and PG on the court, [PAUSE] still maintaining a playoff-ready squad. [PAUSE] If they swapped that pick for a veteran, [PAUSE] they'd end up top-heavy and too shallow to compete.

Yeah, the Sixers were preparing for this all along. [PAUSE] The league’s about to see if their plan actually pays off. [PAUSE] But honestly, getting the top seed isn’t likely — I’d say the Cavaliers have that pretty much locked down. [PAUSE] So, how will the Sixers make it work?

Maybe the Knicks are really close. [PAUSE] Keep an eye on Orlando too—they’ve gotten better with Desmond Bane, but it’s not a sure thing. [PAUSE] If Embiid and PG each stay healthy for around 50 games, Philly might be a five or six seed, maybe four—though they might rest the vets often.

So, [PAUSE] the plan’s to do back-to-back games and rest on road trips, [PAUSE] plus load PG and Embiid’s games to boost both chemistry and health. [PAUSE] Right now, the East standings based on wins show the Cavs leading, [PAUSE] then New York, [PAUSE] and Philly down around eighth.

Playing, you know? [PAUSE] There's a solid chance they could climb all the way up to four if they pull it off and surprise everyone, especially those NBA schedulers. [PAUSE] But honestly, the tough part for Philly might be the next four years, with Embiid and Paul George locked in on the roster.

Wow, in this new apron era, I'm honestly surprised Philly slipped up like that. [PAUSE] Who else was even competing for Joel Embiid? Nobody was offering him that kind of cash so soon. Daryl, supposed to be this GM genius, right? [PAUSE] Yeah, it’s a head-scratcher.

Man, they got caught slipping with those terrible deals, [PAUSE] honestly, next season might be their only shot, since MB and PG aren’t improving health-wise. [PAUSE] All they can do is handle those injuries and really surprise everyone. [PAUSE] But hey, let’s talk about the Cavs…

Hey, did you catch the Evan Mobley body transformation? [PAUSE] It’s all over social media, but here’s the thing — that photo isn’t real, [PAUSE] AI yanked again. Mobley already made big moves, though. He jumped from a top 50 to top 15 player last year. [PAUSE] Impressive, right?

If he takes off again [PAUSE], forget Anthony Edwards or Wimby—his potential’s the NBA’s most overlooked story. [PAUSE]
