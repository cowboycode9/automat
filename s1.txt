On paper, the Sixers look like they could confidently make a run to the NBA Finals. [PAUSE] They've got the recent MVP Joel Embiid leading the way, along with Paul George, and some seriously talented young players like Tyrese Maxey. [PAUSE] When you look at their depth, it's pretty stacked—there's Jared McCain, who was the number three pick, Kyle Lowry, Quinton Grimes on a deal, Jared McCain, and Kelly Oubre Jr. [PAUSE] That top eight is deep enough to be competitive with anyone in the league.

As you look at the NBA landscape this season, [PAUSE] it’s clear the East isn’t quite what it used to be. [PAUSE] The Celtics, Pacers, and Bucks have all taken some hits, and things are now kind of up in the air. [PAUSE] Meanwhile, the Knicks just made a surprising move by firing Tom Thibodeau, [PAUSE] arguably their best coach in years, [PAUSE] and replacing him with Mike Brown. [PAUSE] But here’s the thing—Brown’s only won one playoff series in his 12-year career. [PAUSE] So, yeah… things are definitely interesting over there.

How fired up is Philly right now? [PAUSE] Honestly, not very. Their fans seem more downbeat than they’ve been in ages. [PAUSE] And why's that? Well, they just received some really bad news. [PAUSE] But first, let’s see what the NBA itself thinks about Philly’s prospects. [PAUSE] It really highlights how much an NBA team can mean when you look at the number of…

Wow, did you see how Philly's schedule changed? [PAUSE] Last year, they had 27 national TV games, and this year, it dropped all the way down to 14. [PAUSE] That’s a 13-game difference—huge—by far the biggest downgrade in the NBA. [PAUSE] And get this—no games on Christmas or MLK Day at all. [PAUSE] Zero spotlight during the first week. [PAUSE] Feels like the NBA's basically saying, ‘Yo, Sixers, uh, you feel me?’

Guys are going to struggle. [PAUSE] We’re not really interested in having a ton of interaction with them. [PAUSE] But then, they decided to step it up a notch—and go full savage. [PAUSE] The Sixers just got their new schedule, and let me tell you—Philly’s looking at maybe the toughest one in the whole league. [PAUSE] They’ve got a league-high 16 back-to-backs, which is a...

They're a real weapon for a team struggling with injuries [PAUSE]. So, what was the point of doing this to Philadelphia? They're already hurting [PAUSE], and now they add more on top? Why dig the knife in? Well, the NBA doesn’t make moves just out of randomness, you know? [PAUSE] They’re analyzing something. Maybe the same thing Philly fans are freaking out about right now [PAUSE] because…

Yeah, the schedule's tough, no doubt about it [PAUSE], but honestly, the real concern isn’t just the games we see coming up [PAUSE], it’s the stuff that’s not listed on the calendar. Like, will Joel Embiid even be ready for opening night? [PAUSE] We just got some news, and it’s not looking great—huge red flags, honestly. [PAUSE] If you followed what happened with Lonzo Ball, you know how some injuries can suddenly derail everything without warning.

That’s definitely gonna make you pretty nervous [PAUSE], but hey, summer’s here and my favorite way to stay in shape is to get some workouts in. [PAUSE] But for me, the real key is dialling in the diet. [PAUSE] I’ve realized that about 90% of staying in shape comes down to what you’re eating. [PAUSE] And I…

Looking for convenience, a great price, and something that actually tastes good [PAUSE]? My Fit Foods has been a game-changer for me [PAUSE]. A lot of you have reached out and told me you love them too [PAUSE]. They offer pre-made meals that you can have ready in just a few minutes [PAUSE], making it super easy to stay on track without sacrificing flavor.

They really offer so much variety, [PAUSE] I never find myself getting bored. [PAUSE] And hey, it’s a Win-Win — if you check them out and use my discount code AMH25, you’ll get 25% off your first order. [PAUSE] They’ve got stores all over Texas, [PAUSE] but you can also swing into one in Portland or Denver.

More eateries are on the way, but I’ve tried tons of meal prep spots [PAUSE]. Honestly, My Fit Foods blows everything else out of the water [PAUSE]. You’ve gotta give them a look, and don’t forget the code—AMH25 [PAUSE]. 

Anyway, two years back, Embiid finally snagged his MVP, right? Over Jokic…

Joic was putting up some serious numbers—33 points a game, 10 rebounds, and four assists over 66 games. [PAUSE] But then in 2024, he hit a major setback, only managing to play 34 games. [PAUSE] That was because of a torn meniscus that needed surgery. [PAUSE] Instead of chilling out that summer and healing up, though, he just couldn’t resist hitting the court again.

So, a year ago, we watched Embiid snag the gold for Team USA in the Olympics, right? [PAUSE] But, surprisingly, those knee problems flared right back up. [PAUSE] From the very first day of training camp, he was dealing with swelling and pain. [PAUSE] He only managed to get on the court for 19 games all season long. [PAUSE] The biggest issue though? We never really got a clear picture of the full story…

So, here’s the deal with what was really going on [PAUSE] with Joel Embiid. Basically, he was dealing with some issues that weren’t made totally clear. The Sixers didn’t exactly keep the fans, players, or coaches in the loop [PAUSE], which left a lot of questions hanging. Then, there was Nick Nurse, Embiid's coach [PAUSE], just out there in front of cameras all year, trying to make excuses and explain what was happening. But now, after missing an entire season and having the summer to rehab [PAUSE], it seems like things might be looking up.

The nurse mentioned this to me [PAUSE]. I know Joel's putting in a ton of effort, and honestly, things seem promising [PAUSE]. But whether he's actually ready for training camp or not, I feel like there's probably more factors and decisions that need to be sorted out before we even get to that point [PAUSE]. What? How is that even possible? Dude.

He hasn't touched a basketball in ages. [PAUSE] So how is he not ready? [PAUSE] That question kind of makes you think of a couple other guys. Take Kawhi Leonard, for example. [PAUSE] Back in 2017, he dealt with quad tendinitis—an odd injury for an NBA star. [PAUSE] The Spurs finally cleared him, but Kawhi kept saying things just didn’t feel right.

That caused quite a stir in San Antonio [PAUSE], and they eventually decided to trade him. Kawhi has been dealing with a string of puzzling and legit injuries ever since [PAUSE]. Honestly, since 2017, he's missed more games than he's played [PAUSE], and the Clippers usually just chalk it up to knee soreness [PAUSE]. That sounds like…

I knocked my knee on the couch just now [PAUSE] and now I feel like I’m about to wreck my whole career. [PAUSE] So basically, any team that's centered around Kawhi Leonard [PAUSE] never seems to quite get over the hump. [PAUSE] And then there’s Lonzo Ball. [PAUSE] Back in 2022, Lonzo had a minor meniscus tear [PAUSE] and they expected him to be out for about 6 to 8 weeks. [PAUSE] But of course… things don’t always go as planned.

He never made it back. [PAUSE] His recovery in Chicago turned into one of the weirdest stories we've seen in recent NBA history. [PAUSE] He struggled to walk upstairs and even jog. [PAUSE] Doctors were stumped, couldn't figure out why the pain wouldn't go away. [PAUSE] So, another surgery, I suppose [PAUSE], and after making no progress in 2023, he had a…

Sure, here’s a more conversational and natural rewrite of your NBA text with [PAUSE] markers for TTS:

You know, there’s this thing called experimental cartilage transplant. [PAUSE] Zo eventually made his way back last year, but honestly, no one can promise how he'll perform long-term. [PAUSE] And here’s the real worry: Embiid seems to be following the same kind of path as Lonzo Ball and Kawhi Leonard. [PAUSE] Mysterious injuries, repeat surgeries, and zero clear answers. [PAUSE] An anonymous NBA medical insider told Clutch Points, "When you have a second surgery..." [PAUSE]

To try and fix this initial issue, and then you get even more problems on top of it, and that’s rarely a good sign. [PAUSE] You see, only a handful of players have managed to bounce back from multiple surgeries and injuries to the same spot of their body—that’s the challenge Joel is up against right now. [PAUSE] Not exactly a promising situation. So, yeah…

The NBA’s aware of this pattern, and they’re probably thinking, [PAUSE] “We've seen this story plenty of times, and it usually doesn’t work out well.” So, Philly — yeah, they’re saying goodbye now. Then you’ve got Paul George, [PAUSE] dealing with a bunch of injuries last season, and now he’s hurt again while training over the offseason. [PAUSE] He even needs surgery. But what if the NBA…

Is it possible they’re ignoring Philly’s potential here? [PAUSE] I mean, maybe they’re counting them out, but honestly, Philly’s lineup is perfectly built for this kind of environment. [PAUSE] Remember when they drafted Jared McCain at number three this summer? [PAUSE] It wasn’t just because of his skills — it was a strategic move. [PAUSE] A lot of folks thought they’d trade that pick, but instead, they went with Edgecom, and that tells you a lot about their game plan.

To bring in an experienced veteran since they’re in full "win now" mode, but that would’ve cost a pretty penny. The Sixers are already shelling out 55.2 million for Embiid and 51.6 million for Harden this coming season. BJ’s on a rookie scale deal, so he's definitely more budget-friendly. But if he even comes close to...

Here's a conversational rewrite with [PAUSE] markers for TTS:

You see, the expectation is [PAUSE] massive value on the floor. That’s how Philly manages to keep [PAUSE] Embiid and Maxey on the court, even with a $107 million payroll, [PAUSE] yet still maintain a playoff-ready team. [PAUSE] If they had swapped that pick for a veteran like Kyle Lowry, [PAUSE] they might be top-heavy, but they'd probably fall short in depth. [PAUSE] So, yeah…

Yeah, the Sixers had this in mind all along [PAUSE], and now the rest of the league is about to see if their game plan actually pans out [PAUSE]. So, how do they intend to make it happen? Well, honestly, aiming for that number one seed isn’t really in the cards [PAUSE]. I’d say the Cavaliers pretty much have that spot on lock [PAUSE].

Alright, so maybe the Knicks are in the mix there. [PAUSE] And you’ve gotta keep an eye on Orlando too— they've boosted their squad with Desmond Bane, but it’s not a certainty. [PAUSE] If Embiid and Paul George each manage around 50 games, then Philly probably lands as a five or six seed, maybe a four if things go right. [PAUSE] But honestly, they tend to sit the vets quite a bit during the season.

So, the plan seems to be managing player loads with a few strategies, like [PAUSE] doing single back-to-back games when possible, [PAUSE] resting players during road trips, and [PAUSE] stacking PG and Embiid's games toward the end of the season to help them build chemistry and stay healthy. [PAUSE] Looking at the projected East standings based on win totals, the Cavs are expected to be on top, [PAUSE] then New York, [PAUSE] followed by Philly, which is sitting pretty much around number eight in the rankings.

Playing right now. [PAUSE] But honestly, there's a solid shot they could climb all the way to four if they handle things smoothly and surprise everyone, especially those NBA schedule selectors. [PAUSE] The main challenge Philly's facing, though, is the upcoming four years with Embiid and Paul George locked in, and how they navigate that.

a Max. [PAUSE] It blows my mind, really, that Philly slipped up like that in this second apron era. I mean, who were they even competing with for Joel Embiid? Nobody else was gonna fork over that kind of cash, and yet, they pulled the trigger too soon. Daryl, supposed to be this GM genius, right? Well, [PAUSE]

This guy got totally exposed with those terrible deals. [PAUSE] Honestly, the best shot they have right now is next season, because MB and PG probably aren’t going to get any healthier than they are at this point. [PAUSE] All they really need to do is manage those injuries, and they could surprise a lot of people—blow those expectations out of the water. [PAUSE] But speaking of the Cavs…

Hey, did you catch that Evan Mobley body transformation? [PAUSE] It’s been all over the internet lately. But here’s the thing—they didn’t mention that the photo’s actually fake. [PAUSE] Yep, AI got him again. But between you and me, Mobley already made a real transformation. [PAUSE] Last year, he shifted from being a top 50 player to a top 15 guy. [PAUSE]

If he takes another jump, don’t even worry about Anthony Edwards or Wemby anymore. [PAUSE] That guy’s ceiling is seriously the most underrated storyline in the NBA right now. [PAUSE] His potential could redefine how we look at young stars.
