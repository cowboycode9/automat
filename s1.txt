The Mavericks are really fortunate to land the top pick. You make one of the worst trades in sports history, swapping Luca for AD Max Christie in just one pick. Then, by pure luck, you end up with a once-in-a-generation talent. And Nico Harrison says, "Now I think fans are finally starting to see the vision." What vision? You’re the one calling the shots. So, you’re telling me you got lucky? That kind of thing really drives Mass fans crazy. I could maybe understand if he had snagged Cooper Flag with one of the Lakers picks, but honestly, who's really unlucky here is Cooper Flag. That kid’s always going to be stuck wondering “what if,” you know? With Luca, I know it feels unfair, but it’s the truth. Luca’s over here gearing up for his revenge season, while Cooper might be headed for a tough spot. I get that it sounds harsh, but hear me out. Mads needs to come out on top. And there are two key factors that could make that happen. It's been a long off-season, but I can't wait for NBA basketball to return. Only about a month until preseason kicks off. I'm really looking forward to getting out of the house and checking out the new Rockets team, especially with Kevin Durant and Dorian Finney-Smith. That’s why I wanted to share this with you.

The Mavericks could have traded AD or Kyrie to focus on building around Cooper, but they decided, "No, we're going for the win now." How many other number one draft picks have been in a similar spot? Zachary Reese, no. Wimby on the rebuilding Spurs, no. Paulo Beno, you’d have to go all the way back to 1997 with Tim Duncan, and that was in the small-market San Antonio, far from the spotlight. Cooper gets to play alongside three Hall of Fame players in their 30s who They’ve already snagged championships with AD, Kyrie, and Klay Thompson. Everyone's expecting big things from him at just 18 years old. Imagine those other top prospects on a team that’s all about winning right now, where every move they make is scrutinized. You have to be flawless. Instead, they… You’ve got to learn and get comfortable with being the franchise guy. But Cooper, we’ve heard all the hype about you. You better live up to it. And social media? It’s way harsher—like ten times more intense. Maybe it’s even worse than we thought. Because the very first thing that could make or break Cooper Flag’s season is... This is all about the Jason Kidd experiment. The Mavericks coach mentioned he’s looking to replicate what he did with a young Giannis years ago. You know, back in the day, Giannis showed glimpses of having serious ball-handling skills, and everyone was thinking, "Wow, imagine if this freak could do everything." So, at just 21 years old, Kid, a former point guard, handed the ball to Giannis full time. Last season, they split the guard duties pretty evenly, about 40-60 between point guard and shooting guard. They ended up dropping that setup after just one season, but Kid’s interested in giving it another shot. I’m thinking I want to put him back at point guard. I want to make that happen. Make him feel a bit uneasy and watch how he responds, see if he's able to take control, step into the shooting guard role, or play small forward. He’s comfortable with those positions, but we’re looking to challenge him a bit more. I believe he'll handle it well and react positively. Honestly, you really want him to, because if not… Is it really tough enough being an 18-year-old star already under the spotlight? Apparently, we’re not done piling on. To be fair, Coupe did handle the ball a lot at Duke. Last year, he averaged 4.2 assists and had 156 assists in total, which was 41 more than his next closest teammate. Still, he’s a rookie point guard. Point guard is widely considered the hardest role to play in the NBA. And honestly, we’re about to tackle this for no real reason. There’s so much to think about—defenses, the pace of the game, and Giannis didn’t necessarily have this big spotlight on him from the start. But if Kid tries to jump into this right away, it could end up being a total mess. See what I mean? The NBA really kicked off the Mavericks' schedule with a bunch of home games, which is pretty great. Their first five games are all in Dallas, and out of the first 18, 13 are played at home. But on the flip side, that means the final stretch gets pretty road-heavy. So, if Dallas wants to make a strong push, they really need to come out of the gate hot. Starting strong is definitely key. About the gate. Remember, missing the playoffs is considered a disaster, right? Well, looking at the historical data, if you start 7 and 3, you’re pretty much guaranteed a spot in the postseason. But if you have a losing record early on, your chances drop to around 44%. As for the Maz’s first 10 games, here’s how they look: they face some red opponents, and last year, those teams missed the playoffs. And Green's team ended up taking the win, so I wouldn’t count out the possibility of a winning record just yet. But with Cooper Flag, a point guard, in the mix, who knows what can happen? The Mavericks really need to keep things steady until Kyrie Irving comes back. Keep in mind, Irving tore his ACL last March, and we just got some important news about his recovery. Here's the update on Kai coming back. To fill his spot, the Mavs picked up D’Angelo Russell. His current reputation isn’t the best, but last season was only a year ago, and he had back-to-back seasons with 18.6 points and over 40% shooting from three as a Laker. Of course, the playoffs are a different ballgame. During a live stream, Kai gave a quick update, and I happen to be at the gym pushing myself a bit more too. That’s the second update I’ve got. I want to be clear about what I was actually doing because it’s all about steady progress, and I’m happy to share it with you all. Had some solid days working out in the gym. I'm healing really well, especially since today’s the 26th. That makes it five months since the surgery. Wow, such good news! Usually, the timeline for coming back from an ACL injury is between 9 and 12 months. That means he could potentially return as early as nine months. In December, I’d say a return after the All-Star break at 33 years old is probably the most likely scenario. Do you think the Mavericks will still be going strong then? Honestly, it all hinges on Anthony Davis. Yeah, Davis. And the latest update? Not promising, unsurprisingly. So, yeah. A new trend among NBA teams these days is having a bonding camp before training camp starts. Honestly, it sounds like the most up-to-date NBA thing out there. Maybe it needs a cooler name, but the Mavericks did have a bonding camp out in Southern California last week. Klay Thompson invited everyone to join, but not on the court. Anthony Davis was there too. He had a surgery in July to fix a detached retina, and strangely enough, he's still not able to play basketball even as of last week. Is that a big deal? I'm not really sure. But hey, welcome to the Anthony Davis experience. It really all hinges on his health, but it's always something with him. So yeah, that's where things stand. Right from the start, Cooper Flag is going to face a lot of pressure. At the same time, Luca is on a personal mission for payback. Recently, he did another photoshoot for the media to showcase his new body transformation. Luca’s making it clear he’s in MVP-level shape and ready to prove himself. On the court, the only player at EuroBasket to make the All-Star team but not reach the Final Four was… not someone you’d expect. The rest of the All-Star picks included Giannis, who took home bronze; Alfred Shenun, who got silver; Dennis and France Vagner, both winning gold. Luca finished seventh overall but averaged an impressive 35 points per game—more than anyone at EuroBasket. Since 1989, he's been in the game and even got a nod for best defensive player. What's happening now? It looks like he's determined to prove the Mavericks wrong and settle some scores. We've seen Luca slim down before—sometimes burgers and beer sneak back in—but right now, his physique is just one part of the bigger picture. This offseason has been a big one for LA. Luca now has something that could really unlock his full potential, something he's never had before. The Mavericks' deep playoff run was only possible because Luca was playing alongside Daniel Gafford and Derrick Lively. The guy loves working with big men in pick-and-rolls and throwing up lobs. Since he started playing with those guys, he's now second in assisting dunks. Luka Doncic entered the league only behind Trey Young in terms of overall talent. Last season, Los Angeles was rolling with Jackson Hayes as their starting center, which really limited what Luka could do on offense. But now, they’ve got DeAndre Aiton in that spot. I’m not saying Aiton is prime Shaq or anything, but we all saw him really turn it on a few times last year. Years back with Chris Paul, that connection between CP3 and Aiden was key to Phoenix reaching the finals, and it’s what helped Aiden land that max contract offer from Indiana. So, if the Lakers can land a near-max Aton for just $8 million a year, it’s like a flip of the Bradley Beal situation—big value for a pretty small price. This is all about giving yourself the best shot to shine. The idea is, if Luca manages to get revenge, even more people will be watching Cooper Flag. That kid already carries huge expectations as the top pick. But honestly, from the very beginning, people have been talking about Cooper as a sort of experimental project, even though it didn’t seem to have a clear reason why. It looks like Kyrie Irving might not return until around February, and the Lakers are really going to need Anthony Davis to step up if they want to have a shot at success. Honestly, it’s tough to say this, but there could be some serious challenges coming their way soon. On a different note, when it comes to the Mavericks, former owner Mark Cuban has been sticking up for Kawhi Leonard and Steve Ballmer. They've been insisting he's innocent right from the start. But these days, a lot of folks are wondering why Mark Cuban is really going all out to defend Steve Ballmer. Is it possible that he was secretly paid off by Dirk Nitzky back in the day? Yeah, that’s one possibility. But honestly, it could be something even more complicated. Sure! Please provide the text you'd like me to rewrite.
