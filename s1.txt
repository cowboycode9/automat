The summer of 2027 might be the turning point for the NBA. Right now, there's a roster of players that the league’s biggest teams are all vying for. You might have your own opinions on the rankings, and that’s totally fine, but I think it’s hard to argue with Nicole Joic and Giannis Antetokounmpo sitting at the very top. Just take a look—I found it easier to highlight a few things to make it clearer. We’re talking about guys who haven’t yet made an All-Star squad. But this isn’t just a fantasy list. Teams are actually making real moves right now to get ready for this. And we’re focusing on who? The Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, Heat, Rockets, and then two darkhorse teams packed with young talent—the Mavericks and Hornets. Can you even picture how this is all going to shake out? Could some of these teams be stacked? It’d be a massive boost, but probably not in the way everyone expects. Personally, my favorite way to stay in shape is combining some workouts with a solid focus on my diet. What I’ve realized for myself is that 90% of staying... Getting in shape really comes down to what you eat. I tend to prioritize convenience, affordability, and, honestly, how good it tastes. My Fit Foods has been a game-changer for me. I've had quite a few of you reach out, telling me you love them too. They offer pre-made meals that... You can be set up in just a few minutes, and they offer tons of options, so I never feel like I’m stuck with the same thing. It’s also a big help for the channel if you take a look and use my discount code AMH25 for 25% off your first purchase. They have locations all over Texas. Plus, I… You could swing by a store in Portland or Denver—more locations are popping up soon. I've tried so many of these meal prep spots, but honestly, My Fit Foods stands out as the absolute best I’ve come across. Definitely give them a look. The discount code again is AMH25. But before… You might say, "Free agency is dead. This list doesn’t really mean anything anymore." And honestly, some of the biggest NBA moves in recent history were all about free agents. We used to structure our entire summers around NBA free agency—think 2010 with the Heat, LeBron heading back to Cleveland, or 2014 when KD joined Golden State—all of those were free-agent signings. But now, this summer, The biggest free agent moves were Miles Turner and Duncan Robinson. Pretty interesting, huh? Can you believe when Paul George joined Philly last year, that was actually the first all-star free agent transfer since 2019? What’s behind that shift? Seems like teams figured out it’s smarter to keep their players, develop them, and then trade them later instead of rushing to make big splash signings. Getting something in return just feels right. Players are into it because they know they’re going to get their payday, no doubts about it. But now, free agency is making its return. An anonymous NBA executive mentioned, “Some teams are already lining up for free agency to come back. There’s a sense that a few of these guys might run out of options soon.” Their contracts are now similar to how players used to get signed, and you’re able to sign them again. Everyone’s watching this closely. Why’s that? Because money’s pretty tight under the new CBA. So, what’s the strategy here? Let’s break down what each team has in mind, starting with the Warriors at the top of the list. They’re really fixated on Jonathan Kinga at the moment, especially in relation to 2027. JK actually offered to sign a three-year deal, but they turned him down. They also want to block the leak monk trade to keep as much flexibility as possible for the summer of 2027. They’re fully aware that Giannis and Joic both hold player options. Choices for that season are out there. But it’s curious why Joic and Giannis would prefer teaming up with a 39-year-old Steph Curry when there are so many other options—like prime Luca Donic just nearby. The Lakers are eyeing 2027 as their future, and that really ruffles LeBron James. He might even consider retiring because of it. Actually, ESPN mentioned that Dorian Finney-Smith was a well-liked presence in the locker room. He played a key role in helping the Lakers go 14-6 over his 20 games with them, but LA decided to let him go to keep their cap space open for 2027, when they hope to have enough room to sign a major free agent. Honestly, it feels like they're just giving up on this season to plan ahead for future glory. The Lakers are banking on two prime years of Luca, all in hopes of landing Yoka Ginyanis. But here’s where the issue comes in. The team has four major players who might be gone before Luca hits his peak—LeBron, Rui, Gabe Vincent, and Austin Reaves. And don't forget Maxi Cleva, who’s also on an expiring deal. All of these contracts are set to expire soon, so maintaining stability or building around them for the long haul gets pretty complicated. Scaling back the entire roster seems to be the plan if the right co-star comes along first, meaning the Lakers might step away from the 2027 pursuit. But then, what’s the story with the Miami Heat? They’re another destination that’s making serious moves and big plans. And it’s not the first time they’ve shown this kind of intent—remember the Jimmy Butler situation? They actually had an opportunity to snag Kevin Durant in exchange for Jimmy, but it didn’t happen. When KD left this summer, the team was all about saying no for 27 because KD's a superstar. But honestly, what could they really do? They weren't winning with Jimmy Butler playing like his dad, Michael Jordan. So, what’s KD supposed to do now? With 2026 creeping closer and things looking uncertain, guys like Luka and De'Aaron Fox are moving into the spotlight. Signing extensions? The focus is on 27, but right now, Bam Adebayo is the only player locked in long-term. Is that enough to attract Giannis or Jokic to South Beach? If it isn’t, then why do the Clippers seem like a more tempting option? They made a huge move back in 2019 by bringing in Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Curious to see what you think about all of this. Do it again in 2027. Now, Kawhi Leonard and James Harden are set to become free agents, but word is that LA is already out on Kawhi. A few GMs have mentioned they believe Leonard will see his contract through with the Clippers, but even if he does, a former staff member said the organization’s main focus is… They’ve finished constructing around Kawhai. Everyone’s aware of that, and Kawhai himself knows it too; the Pablo Tory scandal is what tore their relationship apart. So, what options do the Clippers really have left for Joic or Giannis if Kawhai isn’t part of the picture? The only player currently under contract is Ivita Zubots, so that leaves quite a lot up in the air. Cap space to make an offer. Not many skilled players on the roster right now. But who actually has talent? Three young teams that are eager to contend. First up, the Houston Rockets. They currently have just five players under contract for next season, totaling around 27 million combined. That leaves plenty of room for a superstar to step in and make a real difference. The Rockets aren’t planning to give Kevin Durant a contract extension right now because they want to go through with this strategy. Their message seems to be, “Hey KD, you’re great, but you’re basically just a stepping stone to the superstar we’re really aiming for.” Meanwhile, the next team that’s really looking promising for young talent is Dallas, especially with Cooper Flag emerging. If both Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving are involved in this scenario, it’s shaping up to be an interesting situation all around. Say no to their options. The Mets currently have 105 million dollars cleared from their payroll, which should give them enough cap space for at least one max contract. By then, Cooper Flag will only be 21 years old. It’s pretty challenging to build a winning team around a young player like him, but honestly, who can say for sure? Thinking about how talented he'll turn out to be is one thing. But what about the Charlotte Hornets? They’re not exactly seen as a top destination for free agents, but they do have LaMelo Ball. He's locked in on a max contract, but after him, contracts like Miles Bridges, Josh Green, and Grant Williams will be off the books. LaMelo's the only player with a guaranteed deal right now, so they have some room to maneuver if they want to make moves. So, they all had the shot at landing a co-star, but among these teams, which one’s actually in the best shape to take home this big summer prize? Honestly, it’s the Lakers. They tick all the boxes. Sure, everyone’s got the funds, but they’ve got the location and the star power with Luca, making them the standout contender right now. Donuch. Every other team seems to have at least one question mark. By the way, I really don’t see Houston as a go-to spot. But for some reason, a lot of stars choose to play here. I mean, I live in Houston myself. Honestly, if I had hundreds of millions of dollars, I wouldn’t see the appeal. No offense, but that’s just how I feel. From Harden to Durant, Dwight, CP, and even Charles Barkley, Scotty Pippen back in the day—big stars tend to come through here. Yet, the Lakers seem ready to piss off LeBron and maybe even jeopardize a year of chasing another championship with Luca in 2027. It might be a calculated risk, but not quite in the way most folks assume. See, there's more to it than just the surface. I don’t really see Jokic, Giannis, or Steph hitting free agency anytime soon. I think Joker, Steph, and Giannis will probably end up getting traded and then sign with the team they land on. But honestly, this list of players is pretty stacked. If you take another look, there are still 22 impactful guys. And honestly, even if you’re the Lakers, it doesn’t really matter what your team is doing—this talent pool is massive. You already have your top choice in mind. If that person's not available, then definitely check out these other options for the second or third spots. And honestly, that's what makes this situation so wild — even if Giannis Oriic stays put and doesn’t hit the open market, this is still the most skill-free agent class we've seen so far. Think about it. In ten years, Trey Young will be 29, Donovan Mitchell 31, and Tyler Herro just 27. Those are prime years for players. Plus, you’ve got stars like Anthony Davis and Cat who still have some good years ahead. This isn’t your typical list of castoffs. It’s a solid blend of young talent and seasoned stars still in their prime. Stars and proven champs—that’s what’s got teams so on edge. They really understand this could be the last major superstar free agent class for a long stretch. No surprise, then, that teams are making some tough, desperate calls now for something that might not even be a guarantee two years down the line. Seems like everyone’s feeling the pressure. Talking about the on-court battle here, we’ve got OKC facing Denver, Knicks, and Pacers. But what’s really brewing is a quiet war behind the scenes among owners, GMs, and agents. It’s not just about snagging a star; they’re actually vying to influence the league’s future direction. And just so you know, yeah, I’m wearing something—because, well…you gotta look the part. I'm trying to grow my hair out, and I’ve been getting a lot of comments from you guys saying you hate how my hair looks. I know that’s kind of silly, but at the same time, you’re into the NBA. So, you shouldn’t have to deal with my dumb hair or whatever. Hair, huh? I’ve never really been into hacking stuff myself, but I figure I might give it a shot sometime. Anyway, about this Kawaii scandal—what’s crazy to me is how fiercely Mark Cuban is backing Steve Bmer. It’s almost like he’s doing cartwheels to prove he’s innocent. Why do you think he’s going so all-in on defending him? When you look at when he’s guilty, some folks tend to say, "Maybe Cuban slipped Dirk Nitzky some cash behind the scenes back in the day." But honestly, I think there’s something way more dubious lurking underneath all that.
