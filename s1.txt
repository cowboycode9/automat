Lamel Ball wasn't benched during the game against the Thunder or the Nuggets, but it was the Pacers. Their coach, who only has one win this season, basically told Ball, "We don't need you." Meanwhile, Indiana secured their second win of the year, and this loss made things even tougher for the Hornets. Despite starting the season 4 and 11, LaMelo Ball, the Hornets' star guard, has been showing some real growth. Getting more and more annoyed with how things are being handled, they're willing to consider a trade now. League insiders told Yahoo Sports. Oh, yeah, get the trade talk going, for real. LaMelo might be heading out. But then, just an hour and a half later, LaMelo responds to Kelly Eco with a clown emoji. Seriously, come on, just ignore him. The ball just drops, going nowhere at all. It’s like the story was stuck in neutral. But then, once you really start digging into it, things suddenly become a lot more intriguing. According to Eco, LaMelo is actually willing to consider a trade, which alone is pretty notable. But the real eye-opener is buried further in the report—league sources reveal that the front office is becoming increasingly unsure about the idea of moving him. So, it seems like the team views Ball as a key piece for the future, but they've become pretty tired of him and are now open to moving him. Really? LaMelo calls this guy a clown and says he wants out, and now the front office is also looking to trade him? Sorry, but if both sides are throwing around the idea of a trade like that, it’s pretty clear things are heading in that direction. You really can't miss this because it turns out the Hornets have a new front office addition named Jeff Peterson. He took over the team’s management while LaMelo was still on the roster in 2024. Interestingly, for the first time since they drafted him in 2020, it seems like Charlotte might not be entirely dependent on LaMelo Ball anymore. Brandon Miller has been making a solid impact and looks pretty promising. When things go smoothly, you see Colin Canipple earning the Darkhorse Rookie of the Year title—that’s how spot-on that pick was. And let’s not forget Ryan Caulk Brener and Scion James getting more playing time. The LaMelo Ball situation has caused some pretty sloppy basketball, and honestly, that hasn’t changed this season either. A trade definitely seems like a logical move, but if… One thing recent history has shown us is that once a leak like this gets out, it’s only a question of when it’ll actually happen. Jimmy Butler leaving? It’s bound to happen eventually. Same with James Harden—no matter how much they insist it’s not going down, it eventually does. Damian Lillard, Carl Anthony Towns, the pattern stays the same: it all comes out in the end. Hey, do you remember someone saying the cat won't get traded? Stop making those videos. Yeah, eventually, Nicks will happen. The saying goes, where there's smoke, there's fire. But a lot of folks insist LaMelo can't be traded, saying he's making too much cash and is injury-prone. I want to break down why he's actually different from that. There's a… The reason teams are definitely willing to take a shot on Ball is pretty straightforward, but which teams are we talking about exactly? Personally, I’ve always said that for me, it’s not just about the victory on PrizePicks, but I feel like we’re actually winning in a bigger way. Just look at your screen—wait, what even is this? I have no idea what this is. I’m not sure how many out of the last six, or maybe five out of six, I’ve actually gotten right. Honestly, I feel a lot of pressure to keep delivering, though. My favorite part of the app is that I just input my picks and then sit back and enjoy watching whatever games I’ve chosen. Watching that much more really makes it simple to navigate the app. All you have to do is adjust the sliders for a few player stats, and your picks are set. For tonight, I’ve got two favorites: first is Lou Dort. I’m leaning toward going over on his rebounds. The second pick is for a guy named— Alonza Barnett made some waves in college football. He’s known for his yards both passing and rushing—pretty impressive stats overall. I get it, it’s not the NBA, but I’m really aiming to highlight my top two picks here. If you’re thinking about following along, good luck—no promises, of course. By the way, prize picks are now accessible in 45 states, including California and Texas, so there’s plenty of opportunity to join in.

So… LaMelo entered the NBA and really proved a lot of people wrong. He was the third overall pick, behind Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman, because many saw him as talented but not quite ready to be a serious contender. But he quickly showed everyone otherwise, taking home Rookie of the Year honors over those guys. By age 20, he was already an All-Star. Do you know who’s on that list? Out of all the young stars, only Zion doesn’t seem to be a first ballot Hall of Famer yet. As for LaMelo, that season he played 75 games and shot around 39% from three. But since then, everything’s just fallen apart and gotten worse. Now, he’s hitting a career-low 30% from beyond the arc. LaMelo, man. He’s missed roughly 40% of his games just like he has this season. Awesome. That puts him in the same unreliable category as Derrick Rose. Actually, he's even less dependable than John Morant, Kawhi Leonard, and Anthony Davis. Yikes. So, who’s lining up to trade for that? I guess you could say that all of LaMelo’s issues stem from… Where he plays, that’s the spot. Before the current front office took over, the Hornets were making some really poor choices. They tanked every single year. So, holding out LaMelo kind of made sense at the time. The team also seemed to want him to take wild shots and carry most of the scoring load. When you see those circus shots he pulls off, it’s almost like they were encouraging him to play hero ball. We also understand that LaMelo has a little bit of magic up his sleeve. When he’s taking good shots, he has that Steph-like smoothness in his form. His floaters are next level. Last season, Ball averaged around four of these per game, hitting them at a 48% clip. The only player who cranked out more floaters with a higher success rate was Trey Young. But his… His biggest strength is his vision on the court. It’s like he’s got eyes in the back of his head—he always knows where everyone is. At 6’7”, he can make just about any pass he wants. This play here is a perfect example. He comes off the screen with energy, spots the weak side defense collapsing, and then delivers a smooth left-handed pass right through the gap. It’s a really narrow window, and not many guards could pull off that move. People criticize his defense—it’s understandable—but he’s got the height and skills to be a solid tall guard. The thing is, he's never really been on a strong team with real stakes. They’re always tanking, so he doesn’t end up playing tight defense like he might on a playoff contender. Big surprise, right? That’s definitely the upbeat take on LaMelo Ball, but keep that perspective in mind as you look at the trade scene. I honestly can’t think of a period when we’ve seen so many players with significant flaws available all at once. We’re talking about potential trades involving Zan Williamson, Trey Young, John Morant, Anthony… Davis, Zack Lavine, Demard Rosen, and nobody really wants them. There’s even a report saying that if Trey had any interest in staying or moving, he’d already be on a different team by now. But here’s something to consider—if you’re a team looking for a young point guard and are thinking about making a trade, who would you pick between… Jar, Trey Young, and LaMelo Ball? Well, Trey and Jar are the more seasoned guys and tend to cost a lot more. LaMelo has the shooting touch and at least offers a shot at league-average defense. Plus, he's a huge fan favorite, both on the court and in the locker room. Teammates seem to really like having LaMelo around. But he’s kind of caught in a tricky spot right now. That situation just isn’t working out. In my opinion, LaMelo is definitely the most probable player among all these guys to be moved before the deadline. But before we get into where he might land, we need to talk about his contract. The guy still has three more years on his deal after this season, and that’s an important detail to keep in mind. There’s quite a bit of cash shown on the screen, but not the biggest amount out there. That’s because he’s been hurt. LaMelo missed out on the supermax deal. So instead of earning what Cade Cunningham does, he’s making a paycheck more like Desmond Bane or Vagner from France, which actually makes a slight difference when thinking about trades. But the question is, where could he go? Honestly, I don’t really have an answer to that. want to tease y'all. I want to name my number one destination off the top, then talk about other realistic spots. Number one, Dallas Mavericks. The fit with Cooper Flag is amazing. Once Cooper matures, he would be expected to be the alpha player in Dallas, which is good for LaMelo. Kyrie's best position is actually the two. He's not a real point guard. Naturally, he plays his best next to a real point guard. Great for Kyrie. The defense is also a fit. And LaMelo is good for the tank. We have seen it in Charlotte, right? For years. So, if the Mavericks want to trade for LaMelo, but still go for that top pick in 2026, he's great. What about assets to get back to the Hornets? Well, Dallas has access to just two picks. Their 2031 first round pick and the 2032 swap. Also, whatever they get back for Anthony Davis, he is key to all of this. So, if Dallas is looking for a trade for a point guard, a Per Cooper, trade John Morant, LaMelo all day long. I also want to mention the LA Clippers. Get LaMelo back home. The vision here is to have in the future LaMelo with a Vita Zubots and the cap space to lure whatever guys to LA once Kawawaii and James Harden are off the books. Only assets here to trade with the Hornets. Three first round picks. 2031st, 2032 first, and the 2031 swap. It would be selling low on LaMelo for Charlotte, but I would love for this to actually happen because the Clips are one of the most desperate teams in the NBA. You also have to mention the Miami Heat in any star trade. The question for them is, would they rather have Tyler Herro or LaMelo Ball going forward? What about the Houston Rockets? They have plenty of assets to deal. A young point guard's what they need, and the defense is a good fit around LaMelo. I would sneaky love to see coach Eime Udoko with this dude. I'm not actually sure It’d be quite the combo—something fun to watch, even if LaMelo’s about to dismiss this reporter as a clown. But there’s definitely some truth behind the scenes. Rumors are swirling that the Hornets are starting to get fed up with LaMelo, and he might just be the perfect guy for a fresh start somewhere else. Teams might start thinking to themselves, “Hey, this could be our chance to make a move and see what happens.” All of Ball’s issues could be resolved with a different team, but if the Mavericks don’t land LaMelo, they could be in trouble. Kyrie Irving recovering faster than expected from his ACL tear is a good sign, yet it might not be entirely positive after all.
