The year Milwaukee picked up Giannis, they also handed Larry Sanders a hefty contract to be their defensive anchor. The Bucks envisioned Giannis and Sanders wreaking havoc on the court. Giannis would be slicing through the paint alongside Larry, swatting shots, sprinting up the floor, covering huge amounts of ground. But that never played out. Less than 16 months later... After signing a $44 million contract, Sanders just vanished. He left the game while he was at the peak of his career, only 26 years old and just starting as a starting NBA player. So, what happened? The rumors started flying—some people said he was addicted to drugs, others claimed he was reckless after a nightclub altercation, and a few even suggested he was a bad guy overall. The stories about him getting cited twice didn't help either. There was a time when animal cruelty was everywhere, but once the full story surfaced, it completely changed the narrative. Larry hails from South Florida, born in 1988 to a single mother in a tough street. He never played basketball, but he always had a ball with him. For me, carrying a ball was part of my former life. It’s not like he was gearing up to shoot hoops or anything, but without that ball, I might’ve ended up clinging to a gang just to stay safe. Luckily, I didn’t even bother trying to play. Instead, Larry was pretty quiet and artsy, really into painting and making music. But when you’re like that… Being 7 feet tall at just 15 means you don’t really get much of a say in things. A basketball coach at his school noticed him and was like, “Hey, you should try out for the team.” Before he knew it, Larry was on varsity almost by mistake. He wasn’t polished or anything yet, but he definitely caught attention. Considering his size, length, and natural instincts, he just had a sense of when to leap for a block or swipe at the ball on defense. The thing is, he never played AAU or attended those big scouting camps. Because of that, college scouts didn’t really know about him until a small school called VCU stepped up and offered Larry a chance. He earned a scholarship, and by his third year in college, he really made a splash. He was putting up around 14 points, grabbing nine rebounds, and blocking about three shots per game as a junior. He also had a 77-inch wingspan, which is pretty impressive. Sports Illustrated even called him one of the most exciting players in college basketball. What's wild is that this is a guy who didn’t start playing basketball until he was 15 years old. Without any elite coaching or special early deals, he managed to become a first-round NBA draft hopeful in less than five years. When the 2010 draft rolled around, the Bucks grabbed him with the 15th pick, just outside the lottery. Naturally, his first couple of seasons were tough—struggling to find his footing. Larry averaged about four points and three rebounds during that time. Boards hardly made it into the rotation. But off the court was even more challenging. He said, "I come from nothing, and then suddenly I'm the one in my community with everything. People are supposed to guide you, help you grow, but you're still too young for that. You can wind up lost in all of it." He found himself in a very vulnerable spot. I could tell he was feeling pretty isolated. But two things really turned things around for him. The first was trying weed for the first time when he entered the league. Larry says it helped soothe his anxiety and depression, acting like a kind of medicine. The second big change happened in his third year, but I’m curious—what was it about that year that made such a difference? That year, Larry really made a leap and took a big step forward. He started averaging a double-double regularly, and he even managed a triple-double with blocks during a game against Minnesota in 2012, finishing with 10 points and 10 rebounds. He was so strong around the rim that opponents only shot about 42% at the basket when he was defending. His dominance was clear, and the front office... Feeling like they had their main defensive star secured, the team handed Larry a four-year deal worth $44 million. The GM mentioned, "Larry has put in a lot of effort to earn this. He deserves it." But things took a quick turn for Larry and the Bucks. He ended up in a bar fight and was sidelined for 25 games. Games with a busted thumb. Then he found out he tested positive for THC, and suddenly, his minutes on the court took a nosedive. Meanwhile, Milwaukee was busy drafting Giannis at pick 15—the same spot they had chosen Larry three years before—and the team’s focus was slowly shifting toward him. So, Larry’s final day in the facility was… On Christmas Eve 2014, the Bucks were coming off a tough stretch, having lost eight out of their last 12 games. Coach Jason Kidd told the team to skip celebrating and focus on practicing instead. Larry was so angry about this that he directly confronted Kidd, and the stress got to him—he ended up having a panic attack and had to check himself into a hospital to get help. It became clear that Sanders was struggling with some serious underlying mental health problems that couldn’t be ignored anymore. It was an urgent situation. The funny thing is, smoking weed had previously offered some relief, but that didn’t cut it now. He’d already been flagged again by the league, and things had gotten so chaotic that the police had to be involved when he left the scene. Larry was out in the freezing cold with his dogs, and that was the breaking point. He decided to check himself into a different mental health facility, this time for long-term support. Now, he faced a decision: should he accept the help he clearly needed or go back to the NBA and try to tough it out on his own? Back in February 2015, Larry Sanders made a pretty surprising move by returning $15 million to the Bucks to leave the NBA. It caught everyone off guard because, up to that point, no one had ever willingly given up that much solid cash in the middle of their prime like he did. He was just 26, without any injuries, and was a starter on the team—everything pointed to a promising career ahead. Caliber Center and the Bucks' defensive anchor. He wasn't finished physically; he simply chose a path that most would never even consider. That led to some speculation about what really went down because it wasn’t just a matter of mental health. Folks were saying, "Oh, he's actually a dangerous psycho with that animal." People would say things like, "Cruelty charge," or joke, "Must have been some really bad drugs involved." But once Sanders was released from the hospital, he released a video to clear up all those rumors. He said, "I'm Larry Sanders. I'm just a regular person. I'm a father. I’m a painter. I’m a musician. And sometimes, I like to play basketball." I really wish I’d had the chance to say a proper goodbye to the Bucks. I want them to understand that it was never about them—never about the fans or how they’ve always treated me, because that’s been incredible. It’s just that the decisions I had to make were… well, you know. For my family, that’s what it’s about. He released that video back in 2015, and honestly, back then, mental health wasn’t really on anyone’s radar in professional sports. Sure, maybe people mentioned it once in a while—Dennis Rodman comes to mind—but let’s be real, Rodman was mostly seen as a joke or a clown. In the NBA, guys like DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love later voiced their support and helped bring mental health into the spotlight, making it a more serious conversation. But Larry Sanders was actually one of the first players to really put mental health front and center. Back then, the NBA didn’t even test for THC, so Sanders was really ahead of his time in that regard. He definitely helped push things forward. In the wrong time period, you know? If this had gone down a decade later, he probably wouldn't have faced suspension and might have even found proper support from the NBA. After he recovered, Larry did make an attempt to rejoin the league, but it didn’t really work out. By then, though, it was too late to matter. He turned into a serial entrepreneur, switching gears completely. These days, he runs a production company, a publishing firm, has written children's books, drafted a movie script, produces music, and even has a foundation focused on helping others. Lately, he’s been back on the court playing in the Big Three and overseas. But at the end of the day, his true legacy is proving that basketball is more than just a game. Players might earn huge paychecks, but you can’t buy your way out of mental health struggles. Surprisingly, he’s probably one of the biggest success stories, even though he left the NBA when he was still at his peak. Many others end up broke or face personal problems years after leaving the league because they keep pushing themselves into a grind that’s hard to escape. Larry made a huge sacrifice to take care of himself, one most people wouldn’t even consider. Even though he’s no longer active in the league, he still looks out for players in the NBA today. He’s become a quiet mentor for those dealing with their own mental health challenges, though no one really talks about it openly. Anything, but when they ask him to get in touch, he truly listens and shares what no one ever told him. You're not broken. You just need some support. And the wild part is, he doesn’t even regret walking away. In an interview, Larry opened up and said, "I was dying inside. I needed to" Lately, everyone’s talking about mental health in the league, and it really changes how people see Larry Sanders. He’s not some villain like some might have once thought. Actually, he was way ahead of his time. And as for the money, yeah, he just chose to walk away. From 15 million, but he was heading somewhere—toward his children, his peace of mind, and a life that felt real to him. So, no, Larry Sanders didn’t walk away with a championship ring, nor did he become a lockdown defender. He never formed that big duo with Giannis that the Bucks once dreamed of, but… His impact extends even further. He proved to everyone that success isn’t always about trophies or big paychecks. Sometimes, it’s about prioritizing your mental health, even when everyone around you urges you to push through. And speaking of bouncing back from setbacks to get back on top, there’s Michael Beasley. This guy… After his time in the NBA, he actually spent two full years living out of his car. But what’s even more incredible is how he managed to claw his way back to the top after hitting such a low point—those next chapters are truly wild.
