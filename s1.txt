More info has surfaced about Giannis leaving the Bucks. Ian Begley, who’s considered the top New York reporter, mentioned that in August the Knicks actually made a serious offer—not just a small one, but a real deal. We’re pretty clear on what that offer looked like because Begley also mentioned Jaylen Brunson in the mix. They were completely out of reach. So, it seems like the Knicks likely made a call, either offering Giannis from Knicks Gate in exchange for OG Anobi and Mikal Bridges along with some draft picks, or offering Giannis for Carl Anthony Towns plus Tyler Kick to balance salaries and include draft compensation. But apparently, the Knicks either hung up quickly or didn’t follow through afterwards. Getting wind of this just two months before the season kicks off, and only now? It’s odd. Why would anyone choose to leak it at this point? The obvious reason is that it wasn’t the Bucks who did it—they wouldn’t want this out there. Just check out their social media; they’re really doing their best to act like everything’s fine, like nothing’s wrong. It’s pretty suspicious timing, don’t you think? Nothing’s happening right now. They’re just like that house on fire. This whole “everything’s fine” meme, where it’s like, “Oh, Giannis says he loves Milwaukee, everyone,” but honestly, come on. Just cut it out already. Stop getting so defensive about it—it’s only making things worse. It’s the same vibe as that Kings player, Devin Carter, last night, acting like, “Oh, if…” If I let my hair get long enough, it’ll basically compensate for this hairline. Honestly, everyone can see what’s happening. Just accept it. Right now, Giannis is sporting the worst hairline on the Bucks. I’m not saying they should shave it all off and ship him out or anything, but just don’t pretend it’s not a thing. The Knicks didn’t really leak this either. They’re probably trying to avoid having a player like Carl Anthony Towns thinking they’re being traded just before the season starts. So that leaves just one potential leaker. But we’re only about two weeks away from the NBA season kicking off. Until then, it’s all about Prize Picks. It’s the prime spot to score some cash while catching your favorite sports. Last week, our pick surprisingly came through, which was pretty awesome. We’re definitely giving it another shot this week. But honestly, no matter what happens, I had a blast watching that last NFL game—win or lose, it was just good times. The game just needs to hit that target. But honestly, the coolest part is how simple the app is to navigate. You just put together your lineup and then tweak a few player stats by choosing more or less. It’s super straightforward. For instance, this week I’m planning to go with my first big WNBA game pick, and I’m going with less on that one. Let's talk about Chelsea Gray’s assists. And of course, it’s NFL Sunday, so all eyes on Derrick Henry and his fantasy points. Fingers crossed we hit the mark again after a couple of solid weeks. PrizePicks is available in 45 states, including Texas, where I’m at, and California. Plus, when you play, it’s all about making the most of your opportunities. Here's the deal: put in your first $5 and right away, you'll score $50 worth of lineups at no cost, whether you win or lose. Just use the code AM hoops. So, basically, make your first five plays, and you'll get $50 in free lineups instantly, no matter the outcome, with that same code. Just take a moment to hear what Sham mentioned the other day. When you look at the league... Apparently, he's planning to keep his options open going forward, and his agent, Alex Roatz at Octagon, is on top of it all. Since the draft combine back in May, there's been a ton of buzz around Giannis, and he's been handling all the questions and discussions about it. It sounds like he's going to be the main person managing and guiding this entire situation. What? How does he even know all that? Well, because… Giannis’s agent tipped off Shams about this. That’s often where he gets a lot of his scoop from—agents feeding him insider info. The move seems designed to put some pressure on the Bucks and send a message to everyone else. It’s like, hey, my client might be heading out soon, so start lining up the offers. And by the way, Giannis is looking for… He's playing the good guy, acting like he's all in front of the cameras, saying, "I'm a committed Buck." Meanwhile, he’s got his agent out there leaking the news to do his bidding. Everyone sees right through it. Giannis is the one who leaked this through his agent to give the Bucks some buzz around the league. Oh, but Giannis would never pull something like that. He’s a genuinely good person. His agent definitely wouldn’t act without his approval, and if he did, he’d be out of a job the next day. When the Milwaukee media asked him about it, Giannis just said, "I've said this many times. I..." I want to be in a position where I can come out ahead, and I truly believe in this team. As soon as I step onto the court, I’m fully committed to whatever’s in front of me. If in six or seven months I happen to change my mind, well, that’s just human nature, right? You're really complicating things, Giannis. It’s like if you say you're all in, then add, “Oh, but I might change my mind.” That totally undermines everything else you just said. So, if you honestly don’t believe Giannis is behind these unexpected leaks, I’m not sure what more there is to say. But then again, why do you think it’s him? Releasing this just ahead of the new season? Keep in mind, Giannis has pulled this nerve-wracking stunt not once, but three times already. The big one was back in 2020 during the Bucks' surprise collapse in the bubble. Giannis was pretty vocal about it then—making it clear that if the team isn't in a position to contend, he’s not interested in wasting his time. So, the story’s pretty much been set... Back before the 2021 season, the Bucks pulled off a huge trade, giving up a ton of assets to land Drew Holiday. Just a few weeks afterward, Giannis inked his Supermax extension, officially committing to stay. It was like, yeah, we're all in, and Giannis was saying the same. Fast forward to 2023, and he made it clear he wouldn’t sign again unless the team was genuinely competing for a title. So, to make that happen, they went all out for Damian Lillard. Lillard, and once again, Giannis pushes his way into the conversation. After an early playoff exit in 2024, Giannis openly admits, "I don't want to be 40 and look back with regret for not trying one more time." In response, they end up firing Adrian Griffin midseason—basically a last-ditch effort to keep their superstar satisfied. This kind of thing isn’t out of the ordinary, though. Giannis has a history of doing similar things all the time. Whenever he senses things are headed downhill, he amps up the pressure. That’s not exactly a rare move. Take Kobe Bryant, for instance. He wasn’t planning to stay a Laker forever. When Shaq left for Miami, Kobe was furious. He even went so far as to demand a trade right on camera, saying he’d never wear a Lakers jersey again. Jersey again. How brutal is that? But then the Lakers made a move for Pau Gasol, which helped them secure back-to-back championships. Kobe ended up retiring as a Laker. Even Tim Duncan nearly left the Spurs. The Orlando Magic had shown interest in signing him, and they both believed it was a solid match, but at the last second… Tim decided to give it another shot with San Antonio, and they ended up winning five championships together. And here’s the wild part about that story: Duncan once asked Magic’s former coach, Doc Rivers, if his wife could hop on the team plane to fly back home. Rivers said no. So Tim was like, “Okay, never mind.” I’m rolling with Coach Pop. The thing with Giannis is every time he flexes his muscles or throws out a threat, the Bucks respond by making a move. It’s like they’re always one step ahead, except for that one time with Drew Holiday. It’s kind of like if Kobe had Gasol every year, but no matter what, he kept losing in the first round. Kobe would have definitely figured it out, but it’s a tough scene for Giannis right now. It really annoys me when someone like Charles Barkley makes comments about the Greek Freak. It's funny how some of these players act like they’re automatically owed a shot at the championship every single year. It’s kind of a bummer that he seems to believe winning the title should be a given for him. Honestly, everyone’s chasing that dream. So, what exactly is he implying? First, Chuck asked to leave Philly so he could go win in Phoenix. Then the guy jets over to my city, Houston, to team up with Scotty Pippen in pursuit of a championship. And now, out of nowhere, Giannis isn’t allowed to do the same? It’s a bit confusing, don’t you think? Giannis hasn't gone beyond the second round since his 2021 championship win. He's faced three straight first-round exits while being widely regarded as the second-best player in the world the entire time. Some of that was due to injuries, but let's be clear—he's not entitled to anything. All he’s really after is the chance to play. When you think about what it takes to be truly meaningful in basketball on a global scale, it’s about being an all-world player. Is that too much to ask? Giannis keeps pushing the envelope, applying pressure just like he's always done. But unless some miracle drops from the sky this time, what does a trade even look like? Honestly, there are just two possible directions this could go because the situation is pretty straightforward at this point. The Bucks won’t have control over any of their first round picks until 2031. Because of that, any trade they make is pretty straightforward—they’re either after a package centered around a player to stay competitive or they want their own picks returned so they can rebuild down the line. That’s really the only options for them. If the Knicks are a part of it, then it could actually work, since the Bucks might be interested in exploring that route. Stay in the race, but it’s a bummer they already turned down a deal without Jaylen Brunson. Unless something shifts, they’re pretty much out. The Eastern Conference isn’t exactly stacked, so if the Knicks happen to make it to the finals, I doubt they’ll dismantle the team. That said, who actually holds the rights to the Bucks picks they’re after? Looking to make a comeback? The Hawks hold the control in 2026, but honestly, let's just ignore that for now. Giannis is on the team now, and after that, it’s mainly the Pels and the Blazers. Man, what a great time to be a Blazers supporter. They’re definitely going to take advantage when everything unfolds. I mean, if the Rockets… Looking for a three-team trade, Portland’s just like, “Sure, no worries. We’ll send the picks back in exchange for Reed Shepard and those Suns picks you’ve got.” And if the Warriors are after Giannis, Portland’s pretty chill about it too, saying, “Absolutely, no problem,” in exchange for Jonathan Gaminga and Brandon Pazipski. And I get it, that’s a big ask. The Blazers could make a move and ask, but honestly, they hold all the authority in this situation. If any team is truly that eager to get Giannis, they'll have to come with a hefty offer. Milwaukee is pretty clear—they want their own draft picks returned, and they need them. Portland has some leverage in this, but Giannis also has some sway here because, well, he... He could potentially sign that four-year, $275 million extension next year, just like he’s always done. But this time, Giannis might finally decide enough is enough and say, “Hey, I’m over 30 now." If he really wants to keep chasing championships, he might have to walk away. So, he’s just prepping everyone for that eventual move. So, what about the Spurs, huh? Giannis paired with Victor Wembanyama—that’s a pretty wild combo. Wembanyama has actually been looking impressive out there during the preseason. But it’s really the body transformation he went through this offseason that’s got the NBA on edge.
