A new update on Kyrie Irving seems pretty positive at first glance, but there’s a worry it could set off a chain reaction leading to bigger problems. Mark Spears over at ESPN mentioned that Kyrie appears to be in good shape as he gets ready to come back from his ACL injury. He's training with the clear goal of playing this season, which I’m sure many people are excited about. Fans are definitely relieved to hear that. Most likely around late January for the All-Star break. Sounds great. Though, honestly, we already had a pretty good idea the All-Star break was coming up. But then things get really wild. Someone close to him shared that if it were the playoffs, he’d be able to play right now. That’s how far ahead of schedule he is. What? Kyrie might be back on the court just seven months after tearing his ACL, and honestly, that’s incredible—pretty much unheard of. At 32, he's bouncing back from such a serious injury faster than anyone thought possible. So, how can that be a bad thing? Well, the Mavericks might need to go into a rebuilding phase now, even if it means losing games to secure a better draft pick. But it’s really about more than just that. This Kyrie update might trigger a whole new wave of chaos. Just when Cooper Flag thought the Nico Harrison drama was behind him, he ends up caught in a whole new ordeal. Poor kid can't catch a break, huh? Kyrie’s role in all this makes everything more complicated. Honestly, I’m kind of jealous of how much drama is swirling around it all. You all know I’ve been feeling a bit under the weather lately. So my wife went to the game instead of me. Check out these photos she took of the fans, Kevin Durant, who really played well that night.

Later on, you'll see how often NBA teams catch a break with their franchise players. Take the Warriors, for example—Steph Curry slid all the way down to ninth in the draft, and that turned out to be a huge win for them. Then there’s the Spurs, who struck gold with the first pick in the Tim Duncan draft. But the real difference-maker is what teams do once they've secured that superstar—building around him, developing talent, and shaping a winning culture. That’s where the magic really happens. What really makes a franchise stand out from the rest? Looking at the Warriors and Spurs, they both did an incredible job of crafting rosters that complemented their superstar talent, which essentially laid the foundation for their dynasties. On the flip side, teams like the Cavaliers during LeBron’s first stint in 2010 and 2011, or the Timberwolves with Kevin Garnett, unfortunately failed to fully capitalize on their star power and ended up wasting incredible talents. Talent, huh? So, what’s the plan with Cooper Flag for the Mavs? Are they really going to let two franchise guys slip away? First Luca, now Cooper. It all depends on what they decide to do in the coming months. This situation is huge, and the GM hire will play a big role in where everything goes from here. Just so you know, this could make or break Coup’s whole run with the Mavs. The first big thing is their draft pick. Since they’re focused on building around Luca, Nico Harrison traded away all their future picks except for this year’s. That meant Coupe was thrown into a team that’s supposed to be competitive right now. The catch? They’re just not very good. All Nico got to replace Kyrie was D'Angelo Russell. So Jason Kidd played his rookie at point guard at a position set up to fail. Coupe faced elite defenders, had no one to set him up in good positions, which led to the worst offense in the NBA. I'm talking a 103.2 offensive rating. Got to go back to 2021 to find something worse. Now the good news is kid bailed on point Cooper, moved him to small forward. Since then, his numbers have bumped across the board. Even assists have stayed the same. Against Portland Lake, Coupe double team, spins over Denny Abdia to tie the game. He then goes at all defense to Montani Comra to send the game to OT at the line. At 18 years old, so things are looking up. But here's the problem. Even with Cooper looking better, the team can't just decide to tank. Okay? Tanking is tough. You have to be bad all the time. The Mavs aren't bad enough. I mean, look around the league. Washington historically awful. Brooklyn can't defend a high school team. Indiana in a full-on tear down. These teams are trying to lose. They're naturally terrible. Dallas has to work to be this bad. And that's the danger. If the Mavericks don't stack losses now, they fall into the dreaded middle of the first round zone where you get no star, no chance, but real help next to Cooper. And unlike those other teams, Dallas can't take their time. They don't own a pick again till 2031. This is their one bullet. So these tiny improvements like moving Cooper to small forward, getting a little healthier, getting Kyrie back, those things are good, but they're also catastrophic if you're trying to land a franchise shifting player. You literally cannot afford to mess up a single week of the season. One low win streak, one stretch of confidence, boom, suddenly picking 11th instead of third. And that's the difference between getting a guy who helps Cooper win a ring and getting a guy who's like out of the The Mavericks have been in constant struggle over the past four years, and honestly, that's why they're so worried right now. It’s one of the toughest spots an NBA team can find itself in. So, what’s their plan? They’re holding Anthony Davis back. That’s right, keeping him on the sidelines a little longer—another five days, ten days here and there. But there’s only so much they can do with that strategy. According to Mark Stein, the overall feeling in the league has been that Davis needs to showcase a consistent run of solid, effective basketball through December and January to really catch the eye and build the buzz Dallas is aiming for. And that’s only part of the picture, because… Beyond just the draft pick, landing the right Anthony Davis trade is key to giving Cooper the best shot at success. One option might be to ask Davis to sit out the whole season, tank now and trade him later. But there’s no chance Davis would agree to that. He’s 32, and no way he’d just give up on the season like that. He's only 27 years old. You really think he’s going to spend maybe the final year of his prime just lounging on the couch? Plus, he’s got the option for an extension next offseason. Same deal with Kyrie—no extension yet, but the guy clearly wants to get out there and play. I remember Spear mentioning that someone close to Kyrie told him if it were the case, he'd be ready to go. He could be out there playing in the playoffs right now—that’s how far ahead of schedule he is. I’ve heard he’s eager to get back and feels ready for it. Now, I’m guessing you’re about to tell him to shut it down for the season. Sorry, but both of those guys have a track record of insisting on pushing through and demanding to play when they’re told to hold back. Trade. If the Mavericks want to safeguard that draft pick, they’re in a tough spot. They can let the Stars play and risk ending up with a really poor pick, or they can sit them out and potentially spark a revolt. They’ve already been dealing with a lot thanks to all the drama involving Nico Harrison. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if things get even more complicated from here. AD and Kyrie are probably both thinking, "Get me out of here." But honestly, that’s never going to happen. Kyrie’s genuinely happy in Dallas. So, what makes anyone think things would be different? Kyrie in Cleveland wasn’t a fan of LeBron, which is why he wanted out. Then in Boston, the fit just didn’t click, so he decided to leave. And in Brooklyn, well… He’s got good vibes, so he decided to ask her out. Now he's in Dallas and feeling pretty happy with Luca Dončić. But then Kai happens to realize he's now a mentor for Cooper Flag. Is that really what he wants for his final chapter? Seriously? The guy’s 32, coming off an ACL injury, but he’s still an elite ball-handler. Shot maker, and now he's just going to be another mentor for young guys like the new Chris Paul. Honestly? It’s pretty clear there’s a good chance he’s ready to move on, especially if they start telling him to sit out when he’s still healthy. That’s exactly why Kyrie being ahead of the game makes a lot of sense. The schedule is basically the worst news they could get right now. It puts the Mavericks in a no-win situation. If they let him play, he might mess up the tank effort, but if they sit him, they could damage their relationship with him. That’s just another headache when trying to build around Cooper. They don’t even have a draft pick next year, so it’s not like they have that as an option to fall back on. Do they really have to trade vets now just to tank, while still holding onto enough talent to be competitive next year? That’s a tough spot. Honestly, I feel for whoever ends up with this GM job long-term because it’s like trying to build a team on hard mode. Let’s break down why the Kyrie news isn’t great. Right now, the Mavericks are in the thick of what might be the most critical phase of the Cooper flag era. Protecting that 2026 pick is absolutely vital because their franchise’s future depends on it. It’s not just about getting rid of Anthony Davis; they need to get it right in the trade—really nail it. And honestly, they’ve got to come out the other side of this intact and competitive. Over the next few months, they have to navigate carefully, especially since Kyrie, who’s rushing through his ACL rehab, is supposed to be fine. But instead, his recovery has turned into yet another headache for a front office already overwhelmed by issues. Dallas simply can’t afford to add one more mistake or complication to the mix. They’ve already set fire to Lucas Prime. If they mess up this period, they’re also in danger of torching Cooper flags before anything even begins. But one thing I keep hearing from you guys is that you want two main things in a video: first, positive coverage about the game, and second, spotlighting small market teams. The Oklahoma City Thunder are really impressing right now. I had to dig into what’s making OKC so crazy good this season. They’re on track to break the all-time regular season record, which is wild. And get this—they’re not built like the typical super team with Kobe, Shaq, or MJ, but they’re just as dominant. So how are they pulling this off? Are they sticking to it perfectly?
