Here’s a fresh take on that with a conversational flow and keeping all the details intact: Another injury at the point guard spot. Dang, Kyrie, Howley. Now Fred Van Vleet’s dealing with issues too, and the Rockets were aiming for a deep playoff run. They’re not just your typical rookie team. Last year, they finished as the two seed and even brought in Kevin Frian Durant. But Van Vleet? He’s not your average point guard. Just check out his stats to see what I mean. Exactly, right? I mean, averaging 15 points, grabbing three rebounds, dishing out six assists, and shooting 35% from three—those are solid numbers, but nothing extraordinary. But within this team, it’s about more than just the stats. Fred was really the heartbeat, the leader who played like a coach on the court, the guy who’s always ready to step up and challenge the refs on behalf of his teammates. The whole team, but they added Kevin Durant, which doesn’t really mean much. He’s not exactly known for being a leader. That role definitely belonged to Fred VanVleet. Oh, and age really matters when it comes to winning, especially considering the rest of their regular rotation looked like this. Fred was the only one 30 years old or older. And yeah, that’s pretty significant. It's some good news that their rotation did get a bit older—Dorian Finney-Smith in his mid-30s, Kevin Durant, and even Clint Capela. But honestly, none of those guys are as crucial as a seasoned veteran point guard. Without that, the Rockets' championship hopes seem pretty slim, unless everything magically clicks in their favor. I know a lot of folks... Talking about Russell Westbrook? Well, that’s not exactly the point. Everyone’s acting like the Rockets are already done for. Unless something extraordinary happens, they probably won’t feel the loss of Fred Van Vleet that much. The NBA training camps kick off in just a couple of weeks, but until then, Prize Picks is where you want to be if you're looking to win big. I love grabbing cash while tuning into sports, especially when it’s NFL Sundays. I’ve been glued to every game all season. I don’t always hit the jackpot, but with Prize Picks, the experience is way more exciting. The best part? Their app is super simple to navigate. You just put together a lineup, and that’s pretty much all you need to do. Here's the deal—I'm tweaking some player stats a bit, either boosting or dialing them back. For this week, I’m focusing on the Cubs game. Actually, tonight I’m betting on them to allow fewer than a run in the first inning. I realize that sounds a littlerandom, but trust me on this one. After that, I’m also going with Patrick Corbin least. If Jaylen Herds throws for more than half a yard, you’re all set to move into the weekend with our top discount pick. It’s just that simple. We’ve got more than four and a half strikeouts lined up, so we’re ready to roll. Price Picks is available in 45 states, including Texas, so plenty of folks can get in on the action. And in California, if you throw down five dollars, you get 50 dollars worth of lineups right then and there. Whether you hit or miss, just use the code am hoops. Play five, and you'll get 50 in lineups immediately. Don't forget, code am hoops. Now, regarding the point guard rotation, it breaks down like this: Amin Thompson, Reed Shepard, and Aaron. Holiday, man. Fred was truly the only starting-level point guard they had on the roster. If there was any position they couldn’t afford to lose someone to injury, it was that one. And honestly, it wouldn’t even have been a huge deal if Houston wasn’t a team with serious title ambitions among the younger squads like Spurs and Blazers. Even the Magic aren’t really expecting a deep playoff run, you know? But last year, Houston somehow shot up nine spots and ended up as the number two seed out of nowhere. Check this out. During Harden’s final year, they were the four seed. Then they fell to last place, then second to last. And out of nowhere, they jumped all the way up to the 11 seed. Pretty wild turnaround. So, they ended up in second place. Huh? How did that even happen? It’s really a mix of several talented young players. They didn’t just land one star. That’s why hitting the jackpot with a single player is often overrated. Sure, they got Victor Wanyama—amazing. But he's just one guy. A solid head coach and a seasoned veteran make a huge difference too. In Fred VanVleet, you see just how crucial the point guard position really is. A young point guard running the show can be a disaster in the NBA. Just take a look at the other top contenders’ point guards—SGA, Terry Scarland, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brunson, Luka, and Amin Thompson. Amin’s got game, no doubt, but the guy really struggles with his shooting, which makes a big difference in how effective he can be. This is a real issue since the Rockets as a team are pretty terrible at shooting, and that’s a pretty big deal in 2025. Looking at last year’s Final Four NBA teams, all of them were really strong. And sure, the Knicks are in that mix, but you can tell they don’t rely heavily on three-pointers. When they get them, they rank eighth in the NBA for percentage. But the Rockets themselves, they either don’t take many or they don’t make them. And more than half of the threes they hit last year actually came from Fred Van Vleet, Jaylen Green, and Dylan Brooks. None of those three are really shooting specialists. This year feels like a cruel joke. They did manage to land Kevin Durant, one of the greatest shooters the NBA has ever seen, and that's definitely a win. The problem is, who’s going to create space for him now? Durant can knock down those difficult shots, no doubt about it, but that’s not really what you want him doing all the time. That night after night grind really wears on you, doesn’t it? It feels like the whole year's just a constant hustle. At 37, you're probably craving some simple, smooth plays. Plus, with shooting struggles, their options get pretty limited. Last year, Amin Thompson, Alpurn Shigun, and Steven Adams were pretty unstoppable together. How’s everything with you? To make that happen? So, what’s the game plan? Well, the other guy in the mix is Reed Shepard. He was their third overall pick last year. Known for his shooting touch and playmaking ability, he’s pretty much what they’re looking for. The only catch is, Reed is listed at 6’2 and, honestly, pretty slim for that height. He’s really just... pretty much that height and not much more. Playing elite defense is a must, especially for Udoka’s coaching style, so it’s just not an option. He’s absolutely obsessed with D, and that was the game-changer for their success last year. The best teams all share this kind of obsession with playing top-tier defense, which is exactly why the Rockets were so fortunate to bring him in as their head coach. Coach has his own way of doing things, and that means he’s not going to throw your rookie hot shot out there just because he was picked high or looked impressive in summer league. It doesn’t really matter to him if a player was the third overall pick or flashed in those early games. Honestly, if you compare Reed Shepard to other top picks from last year, you’ll see they all got a similar treatment—they didn’t just jump into the lineup right away. Reed logged about 12 minutes per game during that stretch. There was a stretch in March last year when Udoka sat him out for 11 straight games, even though he was healthy. Those games were pretty crucial, so it was a case of, "We really need to win these." Alright, Reed’s got his game face on, but what’s the backup move if things don’t go as planned? Because the Rockets used their mid-level exception to sign Dorian Finney-Smith, they’re now capped at the first apron, leaving them with just $1.3 million of flexibility. That’s the total amount they can work with right now. And just so you’re curious, Westbrook’s veteran deal… The minimum has to be 3.6 million or even 6 million, so it’s just not doable. Thank God for that. Honestly, if things aren’t improving by the trade deadline, Houston should consider trading Reed Shepard for someone with real experience. I don’t care that he was a third pick—he’s been a huge mistake for this team. Coach, if he refuses to give the kid some minutes on the floor, they've got no real options left. The Rockets claim they’re thinking long-term, but honestly, that might be missing the point. Their window is wide open right now, especially with Kevin Durant on the team. Things can shift in a heartbeat. Remember when everyone was saying, "Oh, the..."? Yeah, it’s all happening so fast. People often say the Grizzlies are here to stay, or when the Pelicans picked up Zion, everyone thought they’d be the future of the NBA. But honestly, nothing's set in stone in this league. All you really have is the present moment. That window of opportunity? It can slam shut pretty quick. The one thing that could turn everything around, though, Bailing them out is something Houston already envisioned. When they took Am Thompson in the draft, it was mainly for his speed and defensive skills, and he proved that right away. But last season, Amin really stepped up on offense too. There were games where he scored 33 points in Boston, and others where he dropped 25 at Madison Square Garden, with 11 rebounds to go along with it. He definitely helped out that night. Actually, that guy had four games last year where he reached double digits in assists. The goal is for him to become a well-rounded player, kind of like a young LeBron James—someone who can defend, handle the ball, and create plays with incredible athleticism. But honestly, nobody expected all this to happen so soon. He’s way ahead of the schedule. If a man manages to take charge and step up, it could really be a positive for Houston. But obviously, it’s not ideal for Fred Van Vleet, since this is the first time he’s taken a gamble on himself and came up short. When Fred first entered the league, He told his agent he preferred to go undrafted, basically telling teams to stay clear so he could choose where to go himself. His main goal was to end up somewhere that would actually give him playing time. In the end, he signed with Toronto, chipped away at his game there, and eventually secured a four-year deal. It all started with an $85 million deal. Then, in 2022, when the Raptors tried to bring him back on a more team-friendly deal, he declined, choosing instead to bet on himself. That gamble paid off when he signed with Houston for a max contract. From going undrafted to earning max money, from trusting his own skills to hitting undefeated streaks until the Rockets decided not to pick up his team option this year. Fred was ready to resign, and he just said, "Great." He spotted another shot. His plan was to do a OnePlus 1 deal at 31, riding this incredible forthcoming season, aiming for one last massive contract to wrap up his career. The guy’s already sitting on generational wealth, thanks to betting on himself. And you know what? Going Hitting two out of three on betting on yourself isn’t too shabby. There’s still a decent shot the Rockets can turn things around and come out ahead. But honestly, it’s definitely a longer shot now that Fred VanVleet’s injury has happened. The Rockets do have a clear long-term vision, though. The issue is… A bunch of top-tier NBA teams were all running similar plays, and at the end of the day, only one team comes out on top. Everyone’s really keeping an eye on 2027 because that’s shaping up to be one of the most legendary free agent classes in history. So, what teams are eyeing that year, and what kind of strategies are they cooking up?
