It’s starting to look like we might be witnessing the final chapter of Bronny James’s time in the NBA. I know that might seem wild, but there’s actually some evidence supporting it. How come? It’s not because of his disappointing preseason. That’s not really the issue. The real story revolves around his dad, LeBron, who’s the one responsible for Bronny landing this NBA spot in the first place. At first, it rubbed people the wrong way. But honestly, why does it matter? What about Giannis Antetokounmpo's brothers? Now, Giannis has two brothers playing for the Milwaukee Bucks. How is that any worse or different? To start, Alex is on a two-way contract, so he doesn’t take up a spot on the main roster. But still… It’s a different story because the Bucks aren’t always gushing about Nassus and Alex like that. Can you picture if they had those two guys on the team and kept pushing them as the future? People would be tearing Milwaukee apart for it. But instead, We sort of let it slide because at least they're upfront about it. Everyone knows it's to keep their star happy, so you just go along with it. But Bronnie, from the very beginning, it’s been a falsehood. The kid missed more than ten games at USC, and after a heart issue, he was only putting up about five points a game. He got arrested. In any other universe, he’d be heading back to school for another year, no question. But this isn’t just any universe—it’s LeBron’s world. His mind’s already made up; he’s chomping at the bit to chase that dream of sharing the NBA court with his son someday. Everyone knew that’s what it boiled down to. So, what did the Lakers have to say about all this? Fans? I just want to clear something up. You mentioned Rob and I didn’t give Bronny anything. Bronny has earned everything he's gotten. Oh, of course. That comment kinda made people start criticizing Bronny right away, but it’s really not even his fault. He’s just doing what his dad is guiding him to do. And now… It's about time he starts standing on his own two feet, since Dad’s been staying away more often these days. Bronny really needs to show he's got what it takes to make it in the NBA. So, how's that coming along? In this video, I take a close look at some game footage from Bronny’s latest performances to see how he's doing. But before we dive into that, Check out this possible explanation for why it might be the end of the line for Bronny in the NBA. I was just messing around decorating the house for Halloween, picking up pumpkins and all that. It’s been fun.

And right now, Braun is on an expiring deal with no team lined up for next season. Plus, that sciatica issue LeBron’s dealing with isn’t anything to take lightly. It’s like a clear sign that his body might be signaling it’s time to step back. But… And there's more to it. When Bronny was picked, he scored a contract worth almost $8 million, with the first two years guaranteed. But now, we're heading into year three of that deal, which means the Lakers have the option to let him go without any strings attached. All signs are pointing toward Bronny having a pretty good shot at catching a break soon. Imagine a call from Adam Silver saying, “Get ready to learn Chinese, buddy.” But here’s the thing—Bronny might have a shot to turn things around, and it all depends on him stepping up and becoming that player LA believes he can be. If he does, all the doubts and chatter disappear. So, how’s that going? Well, once again… Before the preseason kicked off, JJ Reic was asked about Bronny. He responded, “Throughout all of preseason, I just felt like he’s been a lot more at ease and self-assured. He’s a completely different player than he was a year ago.” Honestly, that’s pretty impressive. But what exactly does “totally different” look like at this point? Well, for one, it could be his shooting. Bronny’s offensive game still needs some work, honestly, because shooting isn’t exactly his thing. During his college days, he only hit 26% on three-pointers. In his first NBA season, that rose to just 28%. And looking at his preseason so far, there hasn’t been much change. He’s 2 for 13 from beyond the arc across four preseason games, which is only about 15%. If you check out his mechanics, his form actually looks solid. The drop in his numbers mainly comes down to two factors. Most of his attempts are either off the dribble or heavily contested. For about 95% of players, the harder their shots are to get off—and the more contested they are—the lower their scoring tends to be. But the thing that really bugs me is... What people usually notice about Bronny's game is this. He tends to be pretty relaxed, cool, and not very aggressive when he's not directly involved. Take a look at this play in transition. Bronny just kind of jogs back behind the ball, not really pushing himself or fighting for position. Does that seem like someone who's desperate to lock down a roster spot? That lack of hustle kind of carries over into the second half too. Let's take this play as an example. The ball is headed for a drive toward the left block. As the play unfolds and the ball gets picked up, Bronny on the opposite wing needs to move to a better spot. By doing so, he can open up a passing lane—either setting up a clean three-pointer or forcing the defender to close out. But just watch how it all develops from here. He just keeps himself shifted up, which helps the defender stay in the passing lane more easily. From this position, the Lakers don't really gain any benefit from him touching the paint. When it comes to off-the-ball movement, Bronny isn’t much of a threat. But what about when he’s on the ball? Considering all else, he does have some potential there. Bronnie started preseason as the backup point guard facing Phoenix and Golden State. When he's got the ball, he struggles a bit with pressure. If he's up against defenders who are faster, longer, and more physical—which is basically everyone at the NBA level—it’s pretty simple to throw him off and make him rush. He tends to be more effective when attacking off the dribble. When coming out of pick and roll situations, he struggles with efficiency across all three levels despite standing at 6'3". He doesn’t do much off the ball to create easier scoring chances either. But one area where Bronny’s improved significantly is his passing. He’s gotten better at locating the roller and setting up teammates. They can toss perfectly timed lob passes or thread those tight little pocket dimes all day long. But here’s the thing with the Lakers—they already have two legendary playmakers. So what’s missing? Just some solid 3-and-D players. And as for their defense? Well, this is literally their first defensive possession of the preseason, so… Check out how his back is turned just as the ball crosses half court—totally unfocused. Ryan’s a step behind as everything unfolds. How is he already this inconsistent? For a guy who's under 6'5" and not exactly exploding with offensive skills, you've gotta wonder what’s going on there. Bronny has yet to make a big splash, especially when it comes to edging out competition on the margins. Right now, he’s not that guy. The one highlight he did have was his time in the G-League last season. He put up roughly 19 points per game and shot around 38% from three. He even had a standout game where he dropped 39 points against Santa Cruz. A pro basketball game is always exciting, no matter what. The only catch is, those stats usually don’t carry over directly into the NBA. The reason is that NBA teams tend to look for role players from the G-League. Their top scorer might already be on the NBA team with a big contract, so the G-League stats don’t always reflect how they’d perform at the next level. That’s why, from the G-League to the NBA, it’s a different game altogether. Looking at the last 20 or so G-League MVPs, barely any of them have really made a splash in the NBA. So, Bronny's success in the G League doesn’t necessarily mean he’s destined for greatness in the league. And his spot on the roster? That’s not a given either. At 6 foot 3, if Bronny doesn’t bring the same defensive prowess as someone like Gary Payton II on the Warriors, it’s tough to see him sticking around or making a real impact. Does he bring anything to the table? I mean, the Lakers’ top three players already have questionable defense—Austin Reaves, Luke, and LeBron. So, why is Bronny even on this team? It seems a bit suspicious because wasting a roster spot on Bronny is a pretty big deal for LA, especially since they could definitely use more help. Honestly, adding Thanasis might not make a huge difference for a team like the Bucks since they’re not really in the championship mix anyway. But for the Lakers, a smart move could put them back into that contender conversation. Right now, though, the Nuggets and Thunder are way out in front. We all know OKC is strong on defense, and that’s part of what makes them such a tough team to beat. Champs, but the Nuggets have the top player in the world backed by a tough team. Honestly, this might be the strongest squad Nola Joic has ever put together. Do you realize how risky that is? On the other hand, the Lakers, they’re definitely in need of at least one major boost this season, and that’s not it. Bronny James. But I don’t want this to come across as all bad. He does have the chance to turn things around with a solid season under his belt. Hopefully, he can at least show more than what he's been able to during this preseason. Honestly, I haven't seen much growth yet, but with LeBron James sidelined, he might have more opportunities. He could be out a lot this season, which might give him even more chances to shine if he steps up. That additional year could give Bronny more playing time and chances to shine. If he doesn’t seize that opportunity, he might find himself retiring alongside his dad sooner than expected. But on a brighter note, if you’re interested in a feel-good story about a young athlete, Ace Bailey was… Maybe the biggest storyline from the NBA draft last summer, besides the Mavericks landing Cooper Flag, was definitely the attention surrounding Jaden Hardy. At the time, most reports painted him as a pretty arrogant, maybe even toxic, young player who could potentially cause trouble for a franchise. But it turns out, he wasn’t the one making those decisions or spreading that attitude. It was someone named Omar Cooper. And now we've just uncovered a new detail about Omar Cooper that makes the whole scandal way worse than we thought.
