Cam Thomas recently chose to bet on himself, and reports suggest Jonathan Kaminga might do the same. What's wild is that we could end up with three players all taking the qualifying offer and risking it for their career. Since 2017, that’s only happened five other times — with players like Alex Land and Narland Soell. Rodney Hood, Denzel Valentine, and Miles Bridges all agreed to one-year contracts, essentially putting their faith in themselves. But did it work out for them? We’ll get into that in just a moment. It’s not something you see every day, and it’s pretty risky. Just how uncommon is it to take this kind of chance on yourself? Well, starting back in 2017, Since 2021, a total of 120 notable players have been involved here. Of those, half chose to stay with their previous teams by signing extensions. Around 35% went on to sign new contracts or accept offer sheets. About 10% have now left the league altogether, and only 4% have attempted to bet on themselves by testing free agency. So, why do we see three players doing it now? In just one offseason? Well, our top trio now includes Cam Thomas, Jonathan Minga, and Quinton Grimes, especially after Josh Giddy recently inked his $100 million contract. At the moment, all three have either offers on the table or the option to accept the one-year qualifying deal. It's all about betting on yourself and aiming to make a bigger move down the line. He was a free agent, planning to cash in the following off-season, but it was a risky move. Do you remember Dennis Schröder? He was a veteran, but he found himself in a similar situation in 2021, playing alongside LeBron and AD. The Lakers saw him as a good long-term option and offered him a four-year deal worth $84 million. However, Dennis was... The Lakers are really feeling the heat. They just won the 2020 championship but then traded away a lot of their core to acquire Russell Westbrook. Now, they’re trying to make a big move to cash in on their chances. The problem is, Westbrook ended up struggling in the biggest moments. In a key Game 5 against Phoenix, he went 0 for 9 and scored zero points, which was a huge disappointment. LA ended up getting eliminated in that series. In the first round, everyone saw Shruder as unreliable and a bit too confident. The problem was, the rest of the league agreed with that assessment. While the C position was getting all the attention and money being thrown around, Dennis signed a one-year deal with Boston for $6 million. He ended up losing out on 80 million in guaranteed money. Ouch. But on the bright side, Side, Shruder hasn't made any excuses about this at all. He kept playing hard, which honestly is more than you can say for some others who totally dropped the ball. As for me, my favorite way to stay in shape is by getting some exercise in, but I always make sure to stay on top of my diet. What do you think? What I’ve realized is that about 90% of staying in shape really comes down to what I eat. I tend to focus on convenience, making sure it’s affordable, and above all, that it actually tastes good. My Fit Foods has been a game changer for me. A lot of you guys have reached out and said the same thing. I know you love them too. These are pre-made meals that you can have ready in just a few minutes. There’s such a wide variety, I never find myself getting tired of them. Plus, it’s a win for the channel if you take a look and use my discount code AMH25 to get 25% off your first order. They have locations all across Texas, and you can even find their stores in Portland and Denver. More locations are on the way soon. I’ve tried tons of meal prep places, but My Fit Foods is still the absolute best I’ve ever come across. Seriously, give them a visit and see for yourself. The discount code once more is AMH25. So, yes, if you play badly, betting on yourself can be a pretty big gamble. And for Kemp Thomas, it’s interesting to note that the Nets just selected a historic five players in the first round, and four of those are ball handlers just like him. Don’t you think the… Are the Nets really trying to give these young players a shot to prove themselves? What's in it for the team to help Cam Thomas improve his financial situation? And honestly, how much more can he truly show at this stage? Some folks have compared him to Trey Young, but honestly, that's really selling him short. To Trey. Yeah, both of these guys aren’t great scorers and don’t do much on the defensive end, but Trey is definitely an elite playmaker. Cam, on the other hand, kind of reminds me of a budget Zack LaVine. When Zack Low mentioned that, Thomas responded on Twitter. Zack argued that the general opinion is that Cam is pretty much an empty stats guy. Calories Bullhog. And Cam said, "Oh yeah, what about me getting double-teamed by this consensus?" Clearly, he trusts his skills, but things could easily go south. Take Nerland Noel as another example. Back in 2012, he was the top high school recruit and ended up as the sixth overall pick in the NBA draft. So, his whole journey... Life was used to referring to him as "the man." So, when the Mavericks only offered him a four-year deal worth $70 million, he thought, "Wait a minute, I deserve a max contract." Frustrated, he decided to fire his previous agent and brought on Rich Paul, aiming for a better offer. But the Mavericks, however, were really upset about that move. Because of this, they withdrew the offer, and he had no choice but to sign a one-year contract worth $4 million. What followed was a complete nightmare. If you’re counting on yourself, this is definitely the last thing you want to experience. First, he underwent thumb surgery and ended up sitting out 42 games. When he finally returned to play, That guy was really struggling. Things got so bad that the coaching staff decided to sit him down and bench him. Meanwhile, his life was already falling apart because he took a gamble on himself. After getting benched, he ended up needing thumb surgery, and the tension in the locker room started to rise. Eventually, he was left with no choice but to accept a minimum contract offer from OKC. From a guaranteed $70 million down to the minimum, he even attempted to sue Rich Paul for poor representation. Nope. Noel, this is all on you. And when you examine Nerland’s Noel, he’s just one of those players we talked about earlier — one of the five since 2017 who have The player who accepted the qualifying offer, betting on himself but ending up failing, is someone we all know. The only real outlier in this situation is Miles Bridges. If betting on yourself has always been such a gamble, why are so many players now seriously considering it? The answer lies in the new collective bargaining agreement. It has made teams much more cautious. They're now... They’re not just handing out huge contracts to guys like Cam Thomas, who can put the ball in the hoop but doesn’t really pass or play much defense. A lot of players are upset with the offers they’re getting—stuff like four years, 50 million. Instead, they’d probably rather bet on themselves with a one-year deal, go out, perform well, and then hit unrestricted free agency next season. Summer used to be the time when guys like PJ Washington would showcase their talents and really boost their profiles. But things have changed. PJ Washington perfectly illustrates this new normal. A few years back, a 6'7" power forward averaging around 15 points and 10 rebounds could easily land a $25 million-a-year contract. Now, he just signed with Dallas for $90 million total, securing his future in a different way. When it came to rolling the dice, the wild part is that the players had to sign off on this new CBA. What were they thinking? Honestly, in just a few years, that massive $75 billion media rights deal will really start paying off, and those big paychecks will be back. Until then, though, some guys are left waiting. They just can't accept the truth. Overconfidence and poor play are definitely risks, but Isaiah Thomas of the Celtics didn’t actually fumble the bag. Some folks say Isaiah Thomas, oh, he really dropped the ball. But they’re mistaken. In 2017, he was coming off an MVP-caliber season in Boston. He even… He mentioned, "They better back up the Brinks truck." Some people thought he deserved a $200 million supermax deal. But during the 2017 playoffs, he tore a labrum in a serious injury to his right hip. Despite the pain, he kept playing because Celtic doctors assured him it would be fine. At that point, teams were then He was really hesitant to give a big contract to a guy who had become limited and then damaged goods. In the end, he only signed a one-year deal for $2 million. It’s not exactly a typical “bet on yourself” situation since he never really got offered the big deal in the first place, but it’s a great example of what? This kind of situation can really happen to a guy who’s already seen his value questioned, especially when he gets hurt at the worst possible moment. That’s where Jonathan Kaminga comes into play. The Warriors have put forward a deal for him: two years for 45 million dollars, with a team option at the end. But now JK is asking for a player option instead, so he can have more control over his future. He’ll have the chance to pick where he lands next offseason. But reports suggest he’s leaning toward taking the one-year $8 million gamble on himself. Do you realize how risky that move is? The Warriors might not give him the key role he wants, or he could even get injured and mess up his plans. Isaiah Thomas. But I wouldn’t be shocked if JK pulls this off and we see Quinton Grimes quickly agree to that team-friendly deal. The thing is, when everyone’s betting on themselves, they’re all aiming for the same pool of money in free agency. If they all choose to accept that bet on themselves route, it just puts everyone in the same boat. Only a few of these deals will actually lead to a payday. But the one guy it really worked out for, the one everyone was hoping would benefit, is Fred Van Vleet. He took a chance on himself and came out on top twice. Van Vleet passed up offers that would’ve made him a second-round pick on a two-way contract. Instead of accepting a non-guaranteed deal, he deliberately decided to go undrafted. His plan was to prove himself in the summer league and gain more control over his career path. He ended up signing with the Raptors, climbed his way up from the G-League, became an important part of the team, and eventually signed a contract. He signed a four-year, $85 million contract. But in 2022, the Raptors asked him to accept a more team-friendly deal, and he turned it down. Instead, he ended up signing a three-year max contract with Houston. From being undrafted to earning max money twice, all because he believed in himself. But for every Van Vleet, there seem to be about three other players who don’t quite make that leap. There are four Dennis Shruers. I really hope we'll hear plenty of inspiring success stories, but honestly, there's a good chance we'll also see at least one new example of how betting on yourself doesn't always pay off. One young athlete who might be truly done with basketball is Ben Simmons. He… Reports are suggesting that he’s thinking about retiring. The Knicks recently passed him a fresh offer, but he turned it down like he has a bunch of other options on the table. So, what’s making him consider walking away? Some folks might have a different story to tell. It's something, all right, but the real reason is something people really don't want to hear.
