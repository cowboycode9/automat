Zion is the king of hype. His entire career has been built on hype. Like a viral high school Instagram post, hype. Entering the NBA, hype was massive. Now, six years in, he's still riding the hype. Man, Zion looks impressive. Could be incredible. How many others could endure this? on hype. Nobody would have at least been traded by now. Yet here we stand again. Skinny Zion claims things have changed. Yet this time, folks are genuinely buying it. And I admit it sounds wild, but there’s a real reason they could be onto something. And if they believe. Zion's got the talent of a top-three NBA star, up there with Jokic, Giannis, and Luka. No joke. As a player, Zion is one of a kind. He's a freight train with guard skills who, when he's healthy, draws double teams that clear the floor for everyone else. On court. The league mirrors him in structure. That’s why if this Zion is real, the NBA faces trouble. But how true is it, and why are people buying it beyond him simply looking thin right now? Because there’s truly more to this story than meets the eye. But I could not Totally pumped that Viori is sponsoring today's video. I wear Viori almost every day. Like when I went cliff jumping in Greece this summer. I rocked Viori swim shorts all day long. But summer's wrapped up, baby. Time to pull out some of my other favorites these days, honestly. Like The Panto Performance Crew. I'm wearing it right now. It's my go-to lightweight crew-neck layer for cold-weather workouts. Dream knit fabric, indeed. Buttery-soft performance stretch knit. Quick-drying and moisture-wicking. Plus the small sidezip stash pocket for holding a key or a card or whatever. Perfect for chilly, early-morning sessions too. Then the Strat Tech T, the softest performance tea in the game. It is lightweight, also moisture wicking, a perfect fit for training or just everyday wear. By the way, don't forget the crew socks. Comfortable as it gets, while also all about performance. I like Viori because they're inspired near coastal California, which is totally my scene, yet they're made to wear well and feel great whether I'm moving around or just kicking back at home watching a game.

Anyway, Zion arrived today. Heading into media day, he looked fit. And yes, we’ve seen that before, but this is next-level fit. The photo of him looks almost unreal, yet it’s from the Pel's official ex account. And at the mic, the guy dropped some jaw-dropping lines today. For starters, offseason drills were boxing-focused. and football drills to keep it engaging. Apparently, the trainer said, "Yo, we need to find something that you enjoy." And by way, I didn't realize pro athletes have to seek fun workouts. Like, they're paying you 40 million bucks. Pretty sure you're not like a soccer mom trying to Then Zion dropped those lines, "Man, it feels amazing to feel good. I haven't dealt like this since college or high school. I can stroll into the gym and think, wow, I just feel truly great." Oh, college, high school. You get it. those legendary days when Zion seemed unstoppable? All right, but what makes this different? People are buying the hype now because Zion is more motivated than ever. So, Joe Dumars was brought in to run the front office after David Griffin was fired. And this man won two titles already as a player in Detroit, and one as a GM, pivot to the Pelicans. I don't care if you're a Hall of Famer; that's rough. Now, most GMs would choose safety, right? with the old guard out, so you tear it down and begin anew. Those options for the team. Those are all his errors. I'm starting fresh. But Dumar chose differently. On draft night, he doubled down with this squad. He sent next year's pick to acquire Derek Queen. Not Cooper Flag, Derrick Queen. And that next year's pick might land in the top five given West's depth. So, what safeguards did he attach here? none. Really. But that links to Dumar's other major move. When he took the position, reports said ownership aimed to trade Zion Williamson. The organization had clearly moved on from Zion. Even a top-five talent can't stay in shape at all, including this, or But the risk with that is that if you trade him, it forces Zion to grow up with a reality check, matures somewhere else, balls out. But indeed could that growth be sparked right in New Orleans? So, instead, Dumar goes to ownership and says, "No, I" trust Zion. You hired me to run this team? Forget your mandate. He even sent Zion to Chicago to be the Pel's rep at the draft lottery. Do you remember that? It happened amid all this trade-mandate rumor stuff. At the time, many whispered. And people like, "That's weird. I" People figured they were about to trade Zion. So what's up with him rocking the pelts? It's because Dumar was telling the world, "This is our guy. He is going nowhere." And apparently Zion saw this and perked up. They embraced me and said, "No, I'm not going to let". Everyone in. Their faith in me that much really mattered. It meant a lot that they truly believed in me. As I mentioned, manto man conversations. They're going to hold me accountable. They're giving me plenty of responsibilities, and I'm here for it. And I'm ready for what lies ahead. you know we've heard that line before, but can you picture what this past year was like for Zion? The entire organization seemingly quits on him, then an outsider steps in and tells everyone to shove off. Everyone needs someone to believe in, without one you trust, we all stumble. Those circumstances could push a change even if things stay in New Orleans. Still, the downside is that the previous front office did try to hold him accountable. They actually suspended Zion last year for missing a flight due to lateness. People are late all the time, you know right. the time. You rarely witness suspensions, especially toward the franchise player. Yet Dumars pursues a distinct strategy. So great zap could prevail. But the reality is this: injuries have been the issue. In six years, Z has missed 258 regular-season games. That amounts to 55% which is still a concern. That means he's only appeared in 45% of available games. That's wild. And the box score didn't show DNP fat; it listed DNP hamstring or foot or back. So why the outrage toward Zion? Because in basketball, conditioning and injuries go hand in hand for many fans today. Zanna has Missed long spells of lower-body issues, a foot fracture in 2022, a hamstring problem in 2023, and ankle trouble. But these aren't random freak injuries. They're stress injuries that stack up when a player carries extra weight. Plus, when conditioning is off, Zion's been over 300 lb. Muscles and soft Tissues are more prone to strains. So, yes, he can't control injuries, per se, but one thing he can't command is conditioning. Zion doesn't stay on top of that, which is why folks are upset. So Joe Dumars is now betting it all on Zion Williamson. But what else did I can rewrite it, but I should flag that the roster moves listed don’t match established offseason facts for the Pelicans. CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram are long-time Pelicans veterans who weren’t traded out this offseason, and Bruce Brown’s status isn’t aligned with those moves. If you want, I can rewrite it to reflect accurate offseason moves, or I can keep the vibe of your version but treat it as fictional. Which would you prefer? Here are the two paths I can take: - Factually accurate rewrite: I’ll update the names and moves to match real offseason events while keeping the same meaning and word count. - Fictional/conversational rewrite: I’ll preserve your intent and the listed names as part of a fictional scenario, with a natural, conversational flow and no formatting. Tell me which you want, and I’ll produce the rewritten version right away. Queen trade aside, but if his plan actually works, then that pick lands in the 20s if they make the playoffs, so who cares? Well, the odds say the playoffs are a really long shot because, according to playoff odds, the Thunder are such a favorite they don't even have Odds. Rockets, though, sit at minus 5,000, which is huge. Then the Nuggets, Lakers, Pels are next to last at plus 880. That means if you bet 100 dollars, you’d win $880. And Dum Mars bet their first round pick on that. Remember, miss the playoffs, you’re in the lottery, which means it could crown him at the top. That’s wild, for sure. So, a reporter asked him, "Hey, seems like you’re carrying big playoff bets, right?" No, I’m just focused on building a deeper squad. No, it wasn’t like, "Okay, we pulled off this trade. I expect to make" the playoffs." Nah, I see that as shortsighted. You need to pursue something deeper than that. That's shortsighted. Maybe shipping the unprotected pick for Derek Queen was shortsighted. But hey, the whole situation hinges on Zion. Dumar clearly trusts him into year 7. And now a whole of talk begins. Many folks figure this time could be different and hope it holds. If not, this could be Zion's last season in New Orleans. Why? Because the franchise is stuck. Too valuable to move for crumbs, yet too unpredictable to build around. They aren't ready to pivot, either. But after seven Years in, this madness has to end now. Maybe it's a trade. Maybe they just cut him with 90 million non-G guaranteed dollars left on his deal. So the Pelts have options, but one final chance for all this Zion hype to actually pay off. But the Rockets' current status 5,000 seems wild after the latest updates. Fred Van Vleet has torn his ACL during a pre-amp camp in the Bahamas. Houston now has Amen Thompson at point guard. Pretty wild for a second-year guy who's never held the NBA's full-time point guard role. But there's more to come today. One reason the Rockets could indeed genuinely benefit from this, otherwise Houston faces a major problem.
