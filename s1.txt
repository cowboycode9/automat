Things with Jawarant just took a turn for the worse. Some folks thought trading Jaw was nuts, even after all his crazy comments. Now, though, it seems like a deal is way more possible. A few days ago, Jaw was suspended by the Grizz for conduct harmful to the team. Honestly, it looked like he had just thrown in the towel. During the game, he was called out and ended up throwing a fit to the reporters. You can see that type of reaction coming. Just a little while before, he had a confrontation with his coach, and then moments later, it all played out in front of the cameras. He ended up saying something pretty dumb. But two full days later, there was plenty of time for things to settle down. He mentions something even more severe. I want to check out his comments, but the main focus here is new coach Tumas Eelo. He’s the one who directly confronted Jaw, and now we have a pretty clear idea of what he told him. So, Iselo is a… There’s this European guy who shot to legendary status pretty quickly. He used to coach teams with tiny budgets and losing records, and somehow, he’d flip them around and make them champions in no time. Like in Germany, he took over a team that was sitting 13th place. Just two years later, they were lifting the Champions League of Basketball. What’s his secret? Eselos says, “Look, X’s and...” O's are fantastic, but the real trick in coaching is handling the people behind the game. I mean, you could be an assistant coach, knowing all the clever plays and strategies, but when you step into the head coach role, it’s all about managing personalities, egos, and conflicts, not just drawing up plays. So, how does he handle tough or challenging folks on the team? John Morant? Yeah, I remember that game when Jaw just checked out on his team against the Lakers. During timeouts, he was there sulking all by himself, like a spoiled kid making $40 million a year. Totally unacceptable. Eslo mentioned he’s seen this kind of behavior from him before, though.

Keep in mind, this interview happened earlier this year, but it really shows how he tackles things in front of the team with Jaw. You know how well you... You know how there's always that one obvious issue everyone avoids talking about? Like, everyone knows one of the guys is maybe an or he just doesn’t follow through on what he's supposed to. But then you go into the locker room or into the coach’s office after practice, and they’re acting surprised, saying stuff like, he never does this, he never does that. It’s like everyone’s pretending they don’t see what’s really going on. And he doesn’t do this, which is pretty much what every coach does. I told myself I needed to grow and figure out how he’s ever going to change if I don’t bring it up. So, I started discussing it in front of the team. It was more like, listen, you’re holding onto this, and we need to address it. Reach out to us again if you want. You have that option. But just so you know, what you’re doing is causing pain for all of us. You're not accountable to me, but I’m telling you how the others see you. So go ahead and act okay, but know that everyone here feels differently about your actions. He knows it. We just faced everything directly, you know? Started by saying, let’s be brutally honest—what’s the worst possible thing that could go wrong? Yeah, really thinking about it. To be fair to this guy, he later admits that, hey, players… They'd often see that they were being selfish, and most of the time, that realization did the trick. Once they made that switch, they’d come out on top about 80% of the time. Why? Because real pros prioritize winning over everything else and are willing to put their ego aside. But the biggest risk is when a player flips and starts turning against you. That’s exactly what we saw the other night. Jaw got a one-game suspension for the game against the Raptors. He returns in the game against Detroit. The Grizz pushed back in the fourth, cutting the lead to three after a Jaren Jackson Jr. and-one play. But then Detroit started hunting Jaw on defense, with Cade taking some bully ball to challenge him. Bucket. On the next possession, Assar Thompson just snatches the ball right from Jaw. So, two plays in a row, and he's just taking over the game. And then what he said after that? Not great. Do you get the feeling everything’s been sorted out? Yeah, they probably told you that, huh? Well, sure, but they didn’t hear it from you. Clearly, they couldn’t. Let me tell y'all something I didn’t mention earlier. Do you think you’re feeling the same excitement right now that we used to see? Uh, no. Why not? What could be done to bring that feeling back? We’ll find out. Uh, what does that even mean? It kind of makes me think of Jimmy Butler. On the Heat, he said his happiness was missing and wouldn’t be coming back in Miami. A few days after that, he was gone. Part of it might be that Jaw was just getting reminded of how far he's dropped. I just saw Cade Cunningham outplay him, another young guard he used to rival. He's definitely upset, no doubt about that. But once again, the team’s face of the franchise is causing more trouble instead of fixing anything. It seems like the coach called Jaw out, and that totally backfired. The worst-case scenario? The star player turns against the coach, and then things really get messy. Is John Morant fully committed now? Does it seem like he’s finally on board with the team? He really needs to set his ego aside. Honestly, the issues haven't just disappeared; they’ve actually gotten worse. So what’s the core problem? I mean, just recently, Jaw put up 28 points and seven assists in a game and… Gamewinner against Phoenix. Why is he so upset? Well, Elo decided to make one big adjustment. He's now allowing Jaw to handle the offense. But if you look back, Jaw's usual rotation pattern went like this: he played through the entire first and third quarters and then got a breather at the start of the second and fourth. He was... Back in the day, Eastlo played like an all-star. But he’s got a different approach now. He prefers to rotate players in quick shifts—five minutes in, three minutes out, then back in for another five. The goal is to keep everyone energized. Jaw isn’t a fan of that. He wants to be able to control his own minutes and rhythm. A few players can actually pull that off—LeBron, Steph Curry. But Jaw isn’t quite in that league. Especially this season, he’s been really struggling from three-point range. During his first All-Star appearance, we saw some signs of progress beyond the arc, but now he’s hitting new lows. He’s only shooting 14% from three, making just five of 36 attempts. It’s as many missings as makes, and that’s definitely not what you want to see. Air balls count as misses, sure, but it's more than just that. Out of the 22 players taking as many shots as Jaw, he’s actually ranked 21st in efficiency, just ahead of Dylan Brooks. Overall, the offense with Jaw on the floor has a 106.2 offensive rating, which puts them at 28th in the league right now. He's off that jumps to 113.7. Bottom line, things aren't looking good, and he’s pointing the finger at the coach. It’s not just about the missed plays or the low scoring; it’s also about the minutes he’s getting. Jaw feels like his own coach is undermining him. Either Jaw makes a change, or the coach does. So, what’s going to happen next? What’s next? We could chat about trades all day long, but the GM already covered that. Last year, when everything was falling apart, a local reporter from the Grizzlies contacted him. I also reached out to Grizzlies GM Zack Kimman to get his perspective on the latest rumors about Jaw. Here’s what he said. He had to say it. I get why other executives might be dreaming about us trading Jaw, but honestly, it's just wishful thinking. We're not trading Jaw. We stand by our current estimate, Jaw, and the team in the city, and we'll let our performance on the court do the talking. I'm not going to give any more away. This nonsense just adds to the frustration. I’m really looking forward to getting back to basketball. Hopefully, our play will speak for itself this time, though it hasn’t been very impressive lately. A lot has changed since that little comment. First off, they took a step backwards by trading Desmond Bane. And then, when the opportunity arose, they didn’t make the most of it. This offseason, Jaw is taking a break, and people are left wondering why. One thing to understand is that Jaw means more to Memphis than most franchise players in the league. They’re a small-market team that’s never had a player quite like him. His presence drives ticket sales and fills arenas. His star power is massive, and that makes him a really special asset for the team. Jon's aware of that. But what do you think will happen if his performance starts to decline and his popularity drops? How long can they keep relying on the past version of him as the future of the league? It’s a fair question to ask—sure, he might have said those things back then, but has anything changed? Did anything change? Are they now open to trading Jaw? Because usually, when a superstar pushes back so hard in the media, someone’s got to pay the price. We’ll just have to wait and see if the front office prefers ESLow’s old-school style or if he’s on the hot seat moving forward. Now, for the record, The four teams I believe most likely to make a move are the Kings, Suns, Raptors, and Timberwolves. The guy's trade value is so low right now that teams are basically taking a gamble, but we've seen some wild trades happen recently, so anything’s possible. If you’re really interested in actual trade suggestions, I’d be happy to share some ideas. I checked out some of the teams that seem more in need, like the Suns and the Kings, and it looks like they might actually have enough assets to pull this off.
