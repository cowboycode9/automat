The Warriors’ run pretty much wrapped up on April 17th, 2024. That was the day they got knocked out by the Kings in the play-in. It also marked Klay Thompson’s last game wearing a Warriors jersey. He didn’t score a single point in 32 minutes—kind of a rough way to go out. They looked pretty worn down, especially with Steph out there, and it felt like the end of an era. Number 35, honestly, just didn't have enough talent around him. Then they brought in Jimmy Butler. And maybe, with one more major move, Golden State might actually be able to stretch that window even further. There’s always chatter about maybe snagging Giannis or even LeBron James. But what if I told you they might not need that huge trade after all? Because… A few games into this season, everyone’s started questioning what Golden State can really pull off. And the surprise? It’s something nobody saw coming. Because honestly, what did folks expect? Probably a seventh-place finish in the West, maybe fighting for the conference title with Minnesota. Definitely not in the same league as OKC or Denver. You feel me? Here are the genuine contenders, and honestly, it makes sense. Last year, they were a seven seed and got knocked out in the second round. Plus, they might have had the oldest starting five ever. But then, some experts completely disagreed. Kevin Pelton from ESPN predicted they'd win 56 games, right there with OKC. How could he think that? The main reason behind his optimism was… A full season of Jimmy Butler, and honestly, even ESPN couldn’t have прогнозed what we’re witnessing now. We’ve been on a winning streak with PrizePicks lately, though. But let’s be real, making cash is just a side thing for me. The real reason I get involved is because I love putting my picks out there. There’s a little... What I really love is having more juice—that means I enjoy these games even more. And honestly, the best part is how simple the app is to navigate. You just choose more or less for a couple of players' stats, and you're ready to make your picks, like I did with my two choices for tonight. So, first… Up is Ruie focusing less on his PSA, while John Collins is more involved with his offensive rebounds. There are also prize picks available in 45 states, including Texas and California, where I live. If you put just five bucks into Kodam hoops, you can instantly get $50 worth of lineups, win or lose. Losing the game is part of the plan—play five, and you can snag 50 Kodam hoops. But having a whole season featuring Jimmy and Steph could really make a difference. Last year, after acquiring Jimmy, the Warriors climbed to the top of the defensive rankings and finished the regular season with a 23-8 record before entering the playoffs. The only reason Minnesota defeated them so convincingly was because Steph got hurt. Now, it’s the offseason. I’ve got Al Horford and Anthony Melton, which is definitely a win. But now there’s something even more significant happening, and it’s ten times bigger. It turns out the guy Golden State was eager to trade away is actually now the missing piece of the puzzle. Jonathan Aminga, who spent years battling Steve Kerr for more playing time and a bigger role, is suddenly becoming a pivotal part of everything. People had said, “Hey, it’s...”. It's not a matter of if the Dubs trade him this year, it’s when. There was a major contract dispute, but he ended up signing for two years, $46 million with a team option. That set the tone. Kaminga is pretty straightforward to trade, and the team option gives Golden State the power to decide. He could be moved as soon as January 15th. Oh, Dub's fans already know. Take this post on Warriors Reddit, for example, which kicks off with, "Hey, barring a miracle, we’re going to be pretty active in the trade market." Then the guy drops a list of about 34 potential targets, basically anyone but Kaminga. But somehow, that miracle seems to be happening right in Golden State. Kaminga isn’t just… Kaminga's been performing well, and it’s clear he’s gained Steve Kerr’s trust. Some folks thought that was never going to happen, that it was just impossible. So, what changed? Why is this version of Kaminga finally clicking when past efforts didn’t pan out? The key issue really comes down to this: the Warriors shine brightest when they operate as a unified team. Steph Curry is the main guy, obviously. All the role players are expected to support him, but JK was different—he often made it all about himself. He didn’t want to follow the team's flow, which was an issue. Steve Kerr saw this clearly and decided JK needed to be out. For instance, Bball Breakdown highlighted a particular play. Last year, Steph was trying to get Moody to pass so he could… You can see the open shot here, but instead, Ball pauses and hands it off to JK. Just watch Steph’s body language—he’s completely over this guy. Like, what are you even trying to do? Then Steph just signals, “Alright, you’re going to drive,” even though Moody’s chilling in the corner. Meanwhile, Kaminga’s got tunnel vision, eyes on the mid-range shot, contested and all. Missed another one. Last March, JK grabs the ball with about 10 seconds remaining on the shot clock. Enough time to run the play. The Warriors are setting up. Josh is all over Draymond, tight defense. If Dre and Steph set things up, Curry’s got a clear look—perfect mismatch. But instead, JK gets fixated and barrels straight into a brick wall. Kaminga tends to shine when Steph is off the court, mainly because he's mostly focused on his own game in those moments. In the second round, Minnesota put up an average of 24 points without Curry, which looks impressive at first glance. But the truth is, playing well without Steph is only part of the picture. The real goal of being a Warrior is having Steph on the floor to elevate everyone else. And surprisingly this season, Kaminga is actually making it work even with Steph out. In game one, the Lakers on offense, Kaminga gets the ball but doesn’t immediately drive. Instead, he hangs back a bit. Steph then draws defenders towards the hoop, which leaves JK3 wide open. It’s all about working with Steph, not against him. After that, Kaminga passes to Draymond. Steph sets a screen for him, and Ruy’s gaze shifts just enough—he’s briefly distracted by Steph, creating a perfect opening. When JK charges forward and manages to break open, he gets rewarded for it. Offense becomes much simpler when you're playing alongside Steph’s talent instead of fighting against it. But JK's game isn’t just about that anymore. Instead of focusing solely on scoring, he keeps his head up and spots Draymond making a sharp cut for what might be the easiest basket you’ll see. But this… That was easily the most beautiful pass of his career. Tell me you didn’t think it was a triple-team, contested layup. Nope, he simply drops it off to his new teammate, Al Horford. But it’s not just the passing that stands out—JK’s efficiency and rebounding numbers are also through the roof. But if you want to keep going… When Steve Kerr's really feeling positive, it's all about the defense. Kaminga is the guy locking down the opponents' top scorer on a team that's ranked in the top 10 defensively in the NBA. Steve Kerrell mentioned he's officially giving the fourth permanent starting spot to Steph, Draymond, Jimmy, and Jonathan Kaminga. That’s a big deal because Kaminga’s biggest influence has been on the defensive end. For four years, his biggest enemy was actually his own head coach. Things got so tense that he ended up leaking information to The Athletic. Jonathan Aminga has lost faith in coach Steve Kerr, and the 2021 lottery pick no longer thinks Curr will help him unlock his true potential. But nowadays, they’re best. Buds, Kaminga's really turned things around lately. Honestly, he might be exactly what the Golden State Warriors need. Just picture it—a young, athletic wing who can do a bit of everything. It’s not like they really had that before. And when they battled the Grizzlies, the Warriors had four players score at least 20 points. Steph wasn’t one of them, and only three of those guys were. It was Brandon Bazinski, Moses Moody, and Jonathan Kaminga stepping up. That’s a big sign that the old Warriors could really tough out an 82-game season. But the thing is, it’s way more than just JK playing at a high level. This could be the one thing that totally shifts how Steph’s career wraps up. They’ve got younger guys to bring some depth and chemistry to the team. The two-timeline thing could actually work, especially since Steph is 37 now. He shouldn’t have to carry the team like he was back in 2016, constantly pushing through games exhausted because everyone was keyed in on him for 40 minutes straight on defense. That just wasn’t sustainable or fair. If JK really steps into that role—becoming a two-way wing who can generate his own offense and lock down the toughest perimeter defender—that’s something the dynasty has been missing all along. With KD, he wasn’t a homegrown piece for the long haul, and Wiggins wasn’t either. But if Kaminga can develop into that kind of impact player, then Steph’s got something even more dynamic to work with. Steph Curry might not just have one last run in the playoffs—he could have several. If that’s the case, it’s not just about stretching out his career, but it could actually reshape how NBA history views his final moments. The real question is, how deep could those playoff pushes actually go? Because at the end of the day, that’s the only thing that truly counts. Right now, we're talking OKC, but honestly, Golden State has a pretty big edge here. First off, everyone keeps acting like the Thunder are unstoppable. They went all the way to seven games against Denver and Indiana last year. And who knows what might have happened if Hi hadn’t gotten hurt. Sure, OKC looks fantastic, but there’s always that little voice that tells you to stay cautious. Golden State gives them a real fight. Over the past two years, the Warriors have gone three and four against OKC. Two of those losses went into overtime, and the other two times, Steph was sidelined. Also, Jimmy Butler wasn't available for any of those games. So, I’m not really surprised by any of it. They could be considered favorites, but don’t completely rule out the Warriors when facing the Thunder, especially with this current version of Jonathan Kaminga. I’ll be honest, though—this might just be a cover story for what’s really coming next. The Warriors could still be gearing up to trade JK soon. The deadline is coming up, and it’s all about boosting his trade stock with a bigger role now. The Warriors’ upcoming schedule isn’t easing up either—nine of their next 11 games are away. If they can stay healthy and perform well through this stretch, we’re definitely going to consider Golden State a serious contender. The OKC Denver group is really shaping up because Jonathan Aminga is becoming an absolute force. But the biggest jump this season has been Victor Wimanyama. JK might be a candidate for most improved, but Wimi is operating on a completely different plane. Honestly, the Wim everyone used to worry about is finally coming into his own. So, how did he pull it off? What's truly changed in his style or approach that's giving him such a clear edge and making him so much more unstoppable?
